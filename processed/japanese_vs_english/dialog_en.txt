N/A561=I wasn't sleeping, I was awake!
N/A562=Wh-what? Uh, yes, please buy something!
N/A563=If anyone asks, I was wide awake, OK?
N/A564=Take a look…
N/A565=Oh, it's so boring in this godforsaken place!
N/A566=Mmph-- Right! Right! The ash or the oak handle, was it?
N/A567=Ah -- Hello?
N/A568=<yawn>
N/A569=Yeah?
N/A570=What now?
N/A571=…what?

N/A573=<yawn>
N/A574=Goodbye.
N/A575=Come agai...
N/A576=So long.

N/A580=See?  Many kinds of staff.

N/A597=These shields will serve any one in need. 
N/A598=Come, you must need a new helm... or greaves perhaps?
N/A599=Please!
N/A600=Come.
N/A601=Yes.
N/A602=Certainly!
N/A603=Thank you.
N/A604=Thank you.
N/A605=Please.
N/A606=Goodbye, then.
N/A607=Safe travels.
N/A608=Luck smile on you.
N/A609=We sell things for magic users here.  Not for warriors, okay?
N/A610=No, if you're looking for swords, try elsewhere.
N/A611=We sell robes.  Magical robes?
N/A612= I think the best magic is the earth and fire kind.  Don't you?
N/A613=Can I help you?
N/A614=Our rings are high quality -- did you see our rings?
N/A615=Yes?
N/A616=What?
N/A617=Can I help you?
N/A618=Mage goods, right? [checking to make sure]

N/A624=Thanks.
N/A625=Fine arms, strong armor, fit for the Emperor's guard. See what suits you.
N/A626=True spear, sturdy greave -- bright metal glistens high and low.

N/A627=As unto a fine spring rain shall this bow rain arrows.
N/A628=The sound of the blade when swung promotes harmony and long life.
N/A629=The well-armed warrior greets more dawns than his foe.
N/A630=The lotus blossom petals are not brighter than a mage's staff.
N/A631=Yes.

N/A641=How could you pass up such a staff as this? Or have you seen the craftsmanship on this bracelet?
N/A642=Is not this a beauty of a robe?
N/A643=A mage can't find goods like this -- anywhere!
N/A644=Our cloth will never catch fire from your magic.  It is specially made.
N/A645=My staffs -- my staffs are simply the finest!
N/A646=See how finely wrought this ring here is.
N/A647=Please, take a look!
N/A648=Please!
N/A649=Something else?
N/A650=Yes?
N/A651=Can I help you?
N/A652=Bye now!
N/A653=Nothing else?
N/A654=Come again!
N/A655=Oh, you're done?
N/A656=Bye!
N/A657=Oh! Very good. Come, stranger! We have some good things for you today.
N/A658=A fine spear, is that it?
N/A659=A new shield, that's what you want, isn't it?
N/A660=Have you seen my spears? My bows? 
N/A661=Come! Have a look. Many fine things here, many fine things.
N/A662=Please -- all is for sale. All are very good!
N/A663=Please!
N/A664=Have a look.
N/A665=Come come!
N/A666=Yes then?
N/A667=At your service.
N/A668=Good-bye!
N/A669=Good then.

N/A787=What dark threads are these The Fates weave?  Sorrow, chaos, prayers unanswered, hope dimmed like a failing torch … Is there nothing the darkness will not swallow?  In this dark fabric there is but one bright thread.  A gift …
N/A788=Darkness!  I see nothing - nothing.  The future blinded, splintered … the gods fled. The final prophecy unwritten … Is this our doom, or perhaps, our greatest test?
N/A789=Wounds scarred over and wars forgotten long ago - return.  What shapes are these, what images of ancient things come back to light.   Two hands, one timeless … and one so young.  But which is stronger?
N/A790=It is said that greatness is a gift bestowed by the gods.  And it is to greatness that Man shall turn in times of darkness … The torch has been relit, the tapestry complete.  The age of gods has ended.  The age of man has begun.
tagStarting_Cartman_A1=You there, soldier, if you’ve come looking for rest and peace, you won’t find it here in Helos.  Our village has recently been beset by Satyrs and other vile beasts.  The help of your fighting arm would be greatly appreciated.  Our farmers cannot get to their fields, and our supplies are running low.   Please go down the road toward the village and help where you can.
tagStarting_Cartman_A2=Satyrs!  Harpies!  It's as if all the things painted on a vase were sent against us by some angry god!
tagStarting_Cartman_A3=We have men defending every gate.  Farmers and shepherds have come from miles seeking shelter. 
tagStarting_Cartman_A4=You there, soldier, if you’ve come looking for rest and peace, you won’t find it here in Helos.  Our village has recently been beset by Satyrs and other vile beasts.  The help of your fighting arm would be greatly appreciated.  Our farmers cannot get to their fields, and our supplies are running low.  Arm yourself with the contents of this chest.  Please go down the road toward the village and help where you can.
tagStarting_Cartman_A7=Go down the road.  Helos needs your help. 
tagStarting_Cartman_B2=Satyrs?  Those are just old stories, friend.  Or if they’re not, they keep to themselves, deep in the woods.
tagStarting_Cartman_B3=He said the village was in trouble, did he?  Think you could help?
tagStarting_Cartman_B7=You have saved many lives in defeating that Shaman.  Perhaps one day our village will grow back to its former strength.  Surely you did not happen upon us by accident.  It is as if you are a gift from the gods.
tagStarting_Cartman_C2=More than one satyr, or two by the looks of it.
tagStarting_Cartman_C3=It doesn't bode well.  Hard times ahead.
tagStarting_Cartman_C7=Trouble down the road, indeed!
tagStarting_HorseMan_A1=You must have been sent by the gods!  Please, in the field here – they're going to kill my horse!
tagStarting_HorseMan_A2=Help me!  That satyr – those boars – stop them!
tagStarting_HorseMan_A3=My poor horse!
tagStarting_HorseMan_A4=That plough-horse is all I own.  Without it, I can't farm.
tagStarting_HorseMan_A7=A satyr – I never thought I would see a satyr!
tagStarting_HorseMan_B1=You saved my horse!  Thank you!  But I’m not the only one in trouble – down the road there, that’s my village, Helos.  We’ve got monsters at the gates, in the fields – they’re everywhere.
tagStarting_HorseMan_B2=Satyrs!  I never thought I’d see such a thing.  
tagStarting_HorseMan_B3=Just go down the road, you'll see.  
tagStarting_HorseMan_B4=That horse is the one thing I own.  Thank you for saving her.
tagStarting_HorseMan_B5=Normally, we would welcome a weary traveler with offers of food and shelter.
tagStarting_HorseMan_B7=Speak with Diomedes.  You'll find him in Helos, in the town square.
tagStarting_HorseMan_C1=I'm glad to hear the village will be safe for now.  But for how long?  If the beasts return… what will we do?
tagStarting_HorseMan_C2=It's amazing to think… satyrs, things only heard of in tales, now walk our roads and fields.
tagStarting_HorseMan_C3=What took place in the heavens, or deep beneath the earth, that brought these strange times upon us?
tagStarting_HorseMan_C4=My horse and I will have to find a safer place until this madness is over.
tagStarting_HorseMan_C7=Good luck to you.
tagStarting_GuardCaptain_A1=Hello, I am Aeson, guard captain for this small village.   We are holding up... but what's the use?  If the monsters lay waste to our farms, we're lost all the same.  It's that cursed shaman... Diomedes is tearing his hair out over it.
tagStarting_GuardCaptain_A2=The men of this village hold guard on shifts.  Our weapons are rusty and few, but you fight well when you defend your home and family.
tagStarting_GuardCaptain_A7=Enter, traveller, and welcome to Helos.
tagStarting_GuardCaptain_B2=We are still attacked day and night, but your help has lifted a burden from my mind.  If a few Spartans were here, I would sleep well every night!
tagStarting_GuardCaptain_B7=Helos is safe for now.  Seek rest here.  Our merchant has fair prices and our villagers are friendly.
tagStarting_FountainMan_A2=The waters within these fountains are blessed by the gods.  They say when you touch the water, your soul drinks from it.  Should you suffer the dark fate in battle, your body will return to the fountain and you may live to fight again.
tagStarting_FountainMan_A7=Drink from a different fountain, and the soul shall bind to the new location. 
tagStarting_PortalMan_A2=These shrines are ancient – as old as humankind, some say.  They say Prometheus, who brought us fire, built these, too, and in ancient times men traveled by them.  
tagStarting_PortalMan_A7=A very few still can.  Those destined for greatness, touched by the gods.  Even fewer can travel to them with a simple stone, as well.  Or so the old tales claim.
tagStarting_Woman_A1=Monsters!  All over the village!  They’re burning and killing everything in their path.  I’ve never seen such things in my life.  The chaos and destruction it… is all too much for me to handle.
tagStarting_Woman_A2=The satyrs are in our fields, destroying our crops.  At this rate, we'll starve – if we make it that far.
tagStarting_Woman_A3=Please, you must do something!
tagStarting_Woman_A4=It was so awful, they came out of nowhere. We were working in the field, first I smelled the smoke, then there they were. 
tagStarting_Woman_A5=We desperately need your help. Please, talk to Diomedes, our village elder.
tagStarting_Woman_A7=Please, speak with Diomedes, our village elder.
tagStarting_Woman_B1=I want you to know you've saved our lives. All the crops were not ruined – we will not starve through the winter.
tagStarting_Woman_B2=I think I will have nightmares of this day, but they will always end with the brave stranger who saved our lives.
tagStarting_Woman_B3=I will make an offering to the gods and ask them to smile on your fortunes.
tagStarting_Woman_B4=Our village is a friend to the Spartans. They are mighty and rival far-away Athens, the other great power in Greece.
tagStarting_Woman_B5=In harvest season, the whole village works hard to gather all the crops. This year, we hope there will be enough.
tagStarting_Woman_B7=Thank you, traveler. Thank you.
tagLysanderQ1_A1=Hello stranger, I’m Diomedes, the leader of this small village.  Do you mean to say that you fought your way here?  If that’s true then please, I beg of you – we need your help!  Monsters led by a powerful satyr shaman appeared a few days ago and have driven us from our farms.  We can hardly defend the village gates and have no one who can stop them from destroying our crops. Our farmland lies on the other side of the river, just over this bridge.  The shaman was last seen beyond the farms at the edge of the Helos Woods.  Please, rid us of this terrible sorcerer.  We will pay you what we can.
tagLysanderQ1_A2=Please, our farms and our families are not safe.  They'll destroy our crops, our only source of food.
tagLysanderQ1_A3=Our farmers are terrified, they are peaceful folk and are no warriors like the Spartans.
tagLysanderQ1_A4=We barely have men enough to keep the beasts from our gates.  
tagLysanderQ1_A7=Just over the bridge, the farms are right there.
tagLysanderQ1_B1=You defeated the powerful shaman?  Astounding!  Your victory today is great, but I fear there will be more monsters tomorrow.  At least there is enough of the harvest left to feed us all.  Take this gold.  I know it’s not much.  Please seek out the Spartan general, Leonidas.  Petition him on my behalf.  Ask him to send a few of his warriors to protect us – and quickly, before we are again overwhelmed.     
tagLysanderQ1_B2=Thank you again, stranger.  We are indebted to you… but we won't be safe until the men of Sparta guard Helos. 
tagLysanderQ1_B3=Please bring word to General Leonidas in Sparta.  I am sure he will send help.
tagLysanderQ1_B7=Go now, and Zeus watch over you.
tagLysanderQ1_C1=The satyr shaman has not been killed – please, we cannot return to our farms until he is destroyed.
tagLysanderQ1_C7=Please – the evil shaman must be destroyed.
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_A1=You have saved our farms and our livelihoods. For this, we thank you.
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_A7=You have our thanks, stranger.
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_B1=Please, I must beg your help. Our fields have been overrun by strange monsters led by a mysterious shaman.  Will you rid us of this terrible sorcerer?
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_B2=Please, drive the these creatures from our farms.
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_B3=Our entire village depends on the harvest. What will we do if the monsters destroy it?
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_B7=Please, save us from this evil shaman!
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_C1=You have saved our farms and our livelihoods. For this, we thank you. Please, take this, it is what we have.
tagStarting_FarmerSpokesman_C7=You have our thanks, stranger.
tagStarting_Guard_A1=Leave if you must, traveller, but we need your help.  Strange monsters attack our farms.  Please, speak with Diomedes back in the village.
tagStarting_Guard_A2=Diomedes is comforting some villagers in the town's center. I beg of you, go back and speak to him.
tagStarting_Guard_A3=Stranger, we need your help. Please turn back and speak with Diomedes.
tagStarting_Guard_A7=Diomedes is on the other side of the village, near the river.
tagStarting_Guard_B1=Leave if you must, traveller, but we need your help.  The farms are on the other side of the village, across the bridge.
tagStarting_Guard_B2=To get to the farms, turn back and go past Diomedes.  Cross the bridge and you will find them.
tagStarting_Guard_B3=Please turn back and save our farms.
tagStarting_Guard_B7=The farms lie behind you.  This way leads to Sparta.
tagStarting_Guard_C1=You have our thanks.  May Hermes lead you safe to Sparta.
tagStarting_Guard_C2=Yes, the way to Sparta lies down this road - just beyond Laconia.
tagStarting_Guard_C3=Make haste, traveler.  We are counting on you.
tagStarting_Guard_C7=Go safely.  Zeus protects us all.
tagSparta_Traveler_A1=The Spartan army.  Yes, you'll find them just up the road.  They've built a war-camp there.
tagSparta_Traveler_A2=You'll find General Leonidas there. 
tagSparta_Traveler_A3=I said, if you go down this road you can't miss them.
tagSparta_Traveler_A4=If the camp hasn't moved on, you'll have no trouble finding it.
tagSparta_Traveler_A5=Do you think General Leonidas will speak to you, then? 
tagSparta_Traveler_A7=Just down the road here.  Go on!
tagSparta_Traveler_B2=Found them, eh?  How are they faring against the beasts?
tagSparta_Traveler_B7=I wish I knew where all these satyrs and centaurs came from.  Spartans will handle them, though.  If anyone can.
tagSparta_Soldier1_A1=General Leonidas?  He's just ahead, but he doesn't speak with commoners who arrive uninvited.
tagSparta_Soldier1_A2=I told you, he's in the camp. He stands beneath the Spartan banner.
tagSparta_Soldier1_A3=I told you, just keep going, you'll find him.
tagSparta_Soldier1_A7=Let me be, stranger.
tagSparta_Soldier1_B1=Nessus?  The centaur?  He attacked two nights ago.  Slayed two of our guards and galloped off into the valley.
tagSparta_Soldier1_B2=You're either foolish or braver than you look. I'm guessing it's foolish.
tagSparta_Soldier1_B3=They should've sent a force to deal with that thing. It's killed several Spartans.  Ha.  Instead they send some foolish traveler.
tagSparta_Soldier1_B7=Nessus has bested some of our strongest.  You will need more than your sword to drop him.
tagSparta_Soldier1_C1=You killed it? Really?  I mistook you stranger.  Though you're no Spartan, you can fight.
tagSparta_Soldier1_C2=I'm glad it's dead.
tagSparta_Soldier1_C3=I only wish a Spartan hand had avenged Spartan blood.
tagSparta_Soldier1_C7=Farewell.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_A1=Hold it there, no civilian gets in to see General Leonidas, especially when he’s in a council of war. Well... look: a particularly savage centaur named Nessus has killed several of our farmers. He runs wild in the Pellana Valley. We don't have the men to send after it right now. Kill the beast and I'll see you get to speak to Leonidas.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_A2=Normally, you'd be out of luck, but that monster killed two of my friends.  The Pellana Valley lies at the foot of our camp.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_A3=If –  when you've killed that oversized man-horse, come back to me.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_A7=Return to me only when you've killed it.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_B1=So you killed it!  I have to say, I didn't think you would.  You're no Spartan.  Speak with the General if you must.  Be quick!  Leonidas is a busy man.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_B7=Go on, don't make him wait.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_C1=The Oracle, is that it?  Take heart.  It might not be a task for a Spartan, but it's no petty errand for a messenger either.  Remember, you go in the name of General Leonidas – and of mighty Sparta.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_C2=That centaur was as savage and wily as they come.  You must have been quite a warrior to have defeated him.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_C3=Thank you again for slaying that beast. With Aeolus, god of winds, may you travel far and unhindered.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_C4=No, I'm sorry, I can't get you another audience with our general.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_C5=Remember – discipline.  By discipline a Spartan lives and fights, and prevails.
tagSparta_Bodyguard_C7=Safe travels, stranger.
tagLeonidasQ2_A1=So you're the one who brought the Centaur down!  I thought only a Spartan warrior could accomplish such a feat.  So you are here on Diomedes' behalf?  Very well.  I will send a few of my men to defend his village.  This isn't the first petition I've received requesting assistance.  These beasts are everywhere now, and the lazy citizens who mocked Spartan discipline now whine for our help!  No matter; those creatures will regret the day they dared to step on Spartan soil.  {^n}{^n}You must journey to the Oracle of Delphi.  She will know where these monsters come from.  I'd send a Spartan warrior, but I need all of them for battle.  Go to Megara and find my old friend Timon.  He can help you acquire a proper offering for the Oracle.  Young warrior, remember: bravery is not born, it is made.
tagLeonidasQ2_A2=Go now.  I have things to attend to.
tagLeonidasQ2_A7=I said go!
tagLeonidasQ2_B2=I have no time for idle chat with commoners.
tagLeonidasQ2_B7=Be gone!
tagLeonidasQ2_C1=So you're the one who brought the Centaur down!  I thought only a Spartan warrior could accomplish such a feat.  These beasts are everywhere now, and the lazy citizens who mocked Spartan discipline now whine for our help!  No matter; those creatures will regret the day they dared to step on Spartan soil.  {^n}{^n}You must journey to the Oracle of Delphi.  She will know where these monsters come from.  I'd send a Spartan warrior, but I need all of them for battle.  Go to Megara and find my old friend Timon.  He can help you acquire a proper offering for the Oracle.  Young warrior, remember: bravery is not born, it is made.
tagLeonidasQ2_C2=Go now. I have things to attend to.
tagLeonidasQ2_C7=I said go!
tagLeonidasQ2_D1=Hm… Very well.  I will send a few of my men to Helos.  This isn't the first petition I've received. Tribes of satyrs are everywhere now, and I have heard tales of other creatures roaming the wilds of Greece. The lazy citizens who mocked Spartan discipline now whine for our help! No matter; these senseless creatures will regret the day they dared to step onto Spartan soil.
tagLeonidasQ2_D7=I have told you all I know.  Seek the Oracle and do so quickly.  Our darkest hours are at hand.
tagSparta_GateGuard_A2=The Pellana Valley lies behind you.  If it's Leonidas you seek you will find him back in the Spartan camp.
tagSparta_GateGuard_A7=Seek Leonidas in the Spartan war-camp.

tagSparta_GateGuard_B2=Yes, Delphi lies down this road. You will pass through Megara and head up the coast.
tagSparta_GateGuard_B7=You're on the right path.  Zeus guide you, stranger.
tagLysanderQ2_A1=You've returned!!   We shall welcome the Spartans with open arms.  Oh thank Olympus – and thank Leonidas. I must say, you owed us nothing, and so you have earned our eternal thanks.
tagLysanderQ2_A2=So how is he, young Leonidas?
tagLysanderQ2_A3=What he said is true.  The Oracle of Delphi is the keeper of great knowledge.  They say Apollo, the god of prophecy, speaks through her directly!
tagLysanderQ2_A4=You have saved our village, warrior. Thank you.
tagLysanderQ2_A7=We will be safe now. Travel on to Delphi and discover the source of this monster plague.
tagLysanderQ3_A2=Perhaps the Oracle will know something, something that will help us stop the monsters.
tagLysanderQ3_A7=No really, go where you are needed. We will be alright here now that Leonidas has sent men.
tagLysanderQ4_A1=You – you've come back?  But you've done everything you can for us.  You are needed elsewhere.  Don't worry, we'll be fine.
tagLysanderQ4_A2=If what I hear is true, then dark times have spread across our lands.. This darkness threatens the world as we know it.
tagLysanderQ4_A7=You are needed elsewhere.  You should go, I’m afraid.
tagTimonQ3_A1=So, Leonidas sent you?  He must have his hands full if he didn’t come himself.  Monsters are rampaging all over Greece, not just in Sparta.  Perhaps the Oracle can reveal the source behind all these attacks. {^n}{^n}The Oracle requires an offering when one requests an audience.  Take a branch from the sacred olive tree to the Oracle of Delphi, the greatest of the oracles.  Kings and tyrants from the world over seek her prophesies. {^n}{^n}You will find the sacred olive tree in a grove on the road to Delphi, above the Helicos Pass.  Take care warrior.

tagTimonQ3_A2=Leonidas is doing well, I hope.
tagTimonQ3_A3=The road leaving town is a dangerous one.  It will take you past the Halcyon coast and through Boetia – then you will be well on your way.  The olive grove is by the Helicos Pass, just after the village of Ambrossos.
tagTimonQ3_A4=Zeus protect us all and speed you in your journey.
tagTimonQ3_A5=The Oracle of Delphi is the greatest of seers.  Kings and tyrants from the world over seek her prophesies.
tagTimonQ3_A7=Seek the Oracle in Delphi.  She will surely know what brought this plague on Greece.
tagTimonQ3_B1=Monsters are rampaging all over Greece, not just in Sparta.  Perhaps the Oracle can reveal the source behind all these attacks.{^n}{^n}The Oracle requires an offering when one requests an audience.

tagTimonQ3_B5=The Oracle of Delphi is the greatest of seers.  Kings and tyrants from the world over seek her prophesies.
tagTimonQ3_B7=Just follow the road through town, and you'll find Delphi well enough.
tagTimonQ3_C1=Ah, I see you have found an acceptable offering. When you enter the temple of Apollo, be sure to present your gift.
tagTimonQ3_C2=I'm not the one who needs that branch. You should take that to the Oracle in Delphi.
tagTimonQ3_C3=There was no need to retrace your steps. Bring the branch straight to the temple.
tagTimonQ3_C7=You've got the branch. Now speak with the Oracle. She's in the Temple of Apollo in Delphi.
tagTimonQ3_D1=So, Leonidas sent you?  He must have his hands full if he didn’t come himself.  Monsters are rampaging all over Greece, not just in Sparta.  Perhaps the Oracle can reveal the source behind all these attacks. {^n}{^n}Take the sacred olive branch you are carrying to the Oracle of Delphi, the greatest of the oracles.  Kings and tyrants from the world over seek her prophesies. {^n}{^n}  You will find her in the Temple of Apollo in Delphi.  Take care warrior.

tagTimonQ3_D2=Take care on the road to Delphi, I fear even greater dangers lurk ahead.
tagTimonQ3_D3=Zeus protect us all and speed you in your journey.
tagTimonQ3_D4=You had best be on your way, traveler.
tagTimonQ3_D7=Just follow the road through town, and you'll find Delphi well enough.
tagTimonQ4_E1=What are you doing back here, warrior?  Forget something?
tagTimonQ4_E2=Whatever your destiny, I think it lies towards Delphi and not here.
tagTimonQ4_E3=I'm glad to see you're alive and well, traveler.  But don't let me keep you from you journey.
tagTimonQ4_E7=Be wary, monsters are everywhere.
tagCoastal_Laborer_A1=It was a fierce battle, beasts and men, you understand. Then a giant Cyclops, growling and bellowing, came and smashed the bridge! We're working hard, but it will be days yet before the road to Athens is clear. 
tagCoastal_Laborer_A2=You should've seen it, three swipes of its cudgel and the bridge went tumbling!
tagCoastal_Laborer_A3=You'll be able to cross after we're done repairing the bridge.  A few days now.
tagCoastal_Laborer_A4=No stranger, this is the only way to Athens.
tagCoastal_Laborer_A7=The bridge isn't repaired yet.  You'll just have to go somewhere else!
tagDelphi_Villager1_A1=Ah!  The olive grove.  It is true, a sacred tree, old and stately, stood there.  It lies down the road, but I’d stay away if I were you. 
tagDelphi_Villager1_A2=The olive grove is on a hill.  I have watched from here in safety, and for three nights the hill was crowned in flame.  It is ill-fated.  I would keep away.
tagDelphi_Villager1_A3=The road through the Helicos Pass and on to Delphi is treacherous and horrible.  Foul swamps – and deep in the hills, deadly maenads.
tagDelphi_Villager1_A4=Some say the sacred tree belongs to an ancient dryad, a tree spirit, who was a child of Demeter.   Others say the tree was once a beautiful woman who spurned the god Apollo’s love and fled.  In revenge, he turned her into a tree.
tagDelphi_Villager1_A7=I wouldn't go to that olive grove if I were you.  In fact, I wouldn't go near the Helicos Pass at all!
tagDelphi_Villager1_B7=You found the olive grove?  Good!
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_A1=That is my grove burning on the hill above.  The sacred tree is still up there.  She may be unharmed, but you'll have to get past the savage brutes to reach her. 
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_A2=In different times, a traveler would stop in my grove to rest beneath the shade of the great tree, but now none come near.  Those despicable satyrs have burned most of the crop – a foul deed no man would dream of.
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_A3=I only pray that the goddess Demeter has kept safe the sacred tree.  I pray that Apollo strike the satyrs down with a rain of arrows!
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_A4=To reach the sacred olive tree, you must climb the hillside and walk through the entire grove.  The ancient tree looks out over the sea from the cliffside.
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_A7=Go into the grove if you must, but I cannot promise there's anything left of my crop.
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_B1=The tree is unharmed?  Can it be true?  Maybe the gods have not abandoned us after all!
tagDelphi_OliveFarmer_B7=Demeter bring you health, and abundance, and long life!

tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_A5=Enter peacefully and learn the nature of your destiny.
tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_A7=Enter, seeker.
tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_B2=It is proper in the eyes of the great god Apollo to present the Oracle with a gift.  If you wish to find favor with the god of this temple, return to me with a branch from the sacred olive tree.
tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_B7=Obtain the branch of a sacred olive tree.  This shall be your offering.  There is such a tree in a grove above the Helicos Pass, near the village of Ambrossos.
tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_C1=Apollo guide you, seeker.
tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_D1=Traveler, you have brought a gift to bestow on Apollo's Temple.  May he bless you and may he bless your journey.  
tagDelphi_TempleAttendant_D7=Apollo guide you, seeker.
tagDelphi_Delphian1_A2=The sacred olive tree?  Yes, there is a grove above the Helicos Pass, near the village of Ambrossos.  You must have passed right by it. 
tagDelphi_Delphian1_A7=Take the road back towards Megara.  If you reach the village of Ambrossos, you have gone too far.

tagOracleQ3_A1ALT=Welcome, seeker.  It disappoints me Leonidas would not come himself.  Very well...

tagOracleQ3_C2=You have all I can give you, now go where you are needed.
tagOracleQ3_C7=Go now.
tagOracleQ4_A1=What can be told of your fate has been told, mortal. You have found the answers you sought... but the answers are questions, are they not?  And those questions are answers.  Answers which will become clear in time.
tagOracleQ4_A2=You must go now to Leonidas. Tell him what you heard and what you saw.  He rides for Athens.
tagOracleQ4_A7=Go, traveler. Bring your strange news to Leonidas.
tagOracleQ5_A2=You do not need answers or prophesies now – you must act. Go, do what must be done.
tagOracleQ6_A7=Warrior, your destiny calls you. Go.
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_A1=Y-y-you're no monster!  Thank Olympus. You should have seen them, a whole army of the monsters.  Centaurs and harpies and satyrs, marching off ... to where? Just a few still here!  And the worst of them – they're lurking in a cave at the heart of the camp.  Whatever you do – stay away!!  They'll turn you to stone!  I saw it happen!
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_A2=I-i-is it safe now?  Are the monsters really gone?  Ah, gods smile on you warrior!
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_A3=Listen to me, I'm telling the truth – don't go near the cave.  The snake-women, the gorgons, they'll turn you to stone.  A beautiful woman went in there and that's just what they did to her!  I saw with my own eyes!
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_A4=The army was vast, it was great – beasts and monsters of every kind.  
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_A5=It's a good thing you came along. 
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_A7=Oh, the eyes!  Bad dreams… yellow eyes, red eyes.  Hungry… savage.
tagMonsterCamp_Coward_B7=I’ll find my way out of here… as soon as it is safe. 
tagAlalaQ4_A1=I can't believe I let those gorgons get the better of me!  I won’t make that same mistake twice...  Have you heard of the Telkine?  He is a great sorcerer who can summon beasts and monsters to raid and destroy.  My village was attacked by a fearsome Telkine – everyone was killed, everyone but me.  I tracked him here from the far east.  I would have had my revenge too, if it hadn't been for those gorgons nearly turning me to stone.  He now marches his army towards Athens.  By now that city will be under siege.  If you wish to see a Telkine you’d better find him before I do, for I will have my revenge.
tagAlalaQ4_A7=Thank you, but goodbye.  I have... matters to attend to.
tagTimonQ5_A1=A Telkine?  Are you sure?  No one has seen a Telkine since the war between the gods and the Titans.  The Telkines, and their masters, the Titans, were thought to have been banished after the war,  but there’s no time to worry about that now.  Things have not gone well since we last spoke.  The Spartans failed in their attempt to quell the monsters.  Leonidas was humbled by the endless waves of beasts.  He is now attempting to unite the men of Greece – even seeking help from their rivals, the Athenians.  If you wish to find him, I suggest you go to Athens.
tagTimonQ5_A2=To reach Athens, cross the bridge near the ruins of Old Eleusis. 
tagTimonQ5_A7=Travel safely, warrior.  These are dark times, indeed.
tagTimonQ5_B1=These are times of war, and you are needed  elsewhere. 
tagTimonQ5_B7=Travel safely, Warrior.
tagSparta_Watch_A1=Hail, stranger.  If you seek the great general Leonidas, you have taken the wrong road.  Many things have befallen Sparta since you last came this way.  Call me a liar, but Leonidas at this very moment stands before Athens, his back to his old sworn enemies and his face to the monstrous horde.
tagSparta_Watch_A2=The road to Athens is near Megara and close to the Old Eleusis ruins.
tagSparta_Watch_A3=Leonidas has gone. He is in Athens – look for him there.
tagSparta_Watch_A7=No, Leonidas has gone. He is in Athens – seek him there.
tagLeonidasQ5_A1=Ah, it's you again.  Still alive!  I am lucky to be here myself!  I thought we Spartans could stop this nightmare on our own.  I was a fool.  In our pride we refused help from our Greek brethren, and Sparta suffered a great loss to the monsters.  A soldier knows only attack, but I must be more than a soldier.  I must be a warrior and learn to temper my pride.  It has become clear that the Spartans must unite with all Greeks if we are to stand a chance against these monsters.{^n}{^n}I cannot make heads or tails of the Oracle's prophecy, but your deeds in Parnassus are worthy of a hero's song.  This Telkine you speak of must be the leader of the horde that attacked us.  At the height of the battle he disappeared, giving us the chance to drive the monsters back. {^n}{^n}I have heard reports of skirmishes within the city walls.  I cannot spare a runner – would you investigate?
tagLeonidasQ5_A2=I shall not be made a fool again, at least not by the same enemy.
tagLeonidasQ5_A7=If monsters have breached these walls, you would be of more use behind these gates.
tagLeonidasQ5_B2=What are you doing here?  Why didn't you talk to the old man in the catacombs?
tagLeonidasQ5_B7=Go back and talk to him.
tagLeonidasQ5_C1=The Order of Prometheus... I would almost say I had heard that name before, no more than a whisper in my memory.  There's more to this plague of monsters than meets the eye!  If the Order means to strike against the savage beasts then we would do well to form an alliance.  And if their words are true, no task could be more important.
tagLeonidasQ5_C2=Yes, I think you would be wise to help this Order of Prometheus.
tagLeonidasQ5_C3=These secrets and mysteries, they are too much for an old Spartan.  I will stick to the work of uniting Greece against this vile plague.
tagLeonidasQ5_C7=You should be getting on to Crete now, don’t you think?
tagLeonidasQ5_D1=A conduit?  And you slayed the Telkine... but not before the conduit was destroyed?  The tales you tell are strange beyond belief.  They are like the words of the story-tellers who spin rhymes of ancient myths by the fireside.  But your deeds I trust to be true!{^n}{^n}So have you heard?  Every Greek state has vowed to stand together and fight the monsters.  We have put all our petty rivalries behind us.  I would be proud of my hand in all this, but still things remain grim.  These are monsters, brute beasts, they strike from the shadows, here, there, with no sense.  There will be no victory until the last of them fall!
tagLeonidasQ5_D2=Hope glimmers like a sliver of moon in the murky  night.  Your task is to unravel the origins of this curse.  You may be our greatest hope.
tagLeonidasQ5_D3=Like the heroes of old myth, you must be brave and unyielding.
tagLeonidasQ5_D4=Our armies, however beleaguered, will hold Greece.  Your duty lies elsewhere, now.
tagLeonidasQ5_D7=Travel far and be brave, warrior.
tagLeonidasQ5_E1=I was a fool.  In our pride, we refused Greek alliances, depending alone on brute Spartan strength . We were beaten like a boy untrained in arms.  The beasts slipped through our fingers and struck us from behind.  A soldier knows only war, but I must be more than a soldier and learn to temper my pride.  It was clear that we Spartans must unite the armies of Greece to battle this plague.  So it was that we came to defend the gates of our former enemies. {^n}{^n}I cannot make heads or tails of the Oracle's prophecy, but your deeds in Parnassus are worthy of a hero's song.  This Telkine you speak of must be the captain that led the horde against us.  At the height of the battle he disappeared and the tide turned in our favor. Now we drive the monsters back.  I have heard reports of skirmishes within the city walls.  I cannot spare a runner – would you investigate?
tagLeonidasQ5_E2=I shall not be made a fool again, at least not by the same enemy.
tagLeonidasQ5_E7=If monsters have breached these walls, you would be of more use behind these gates.
tagKyrosQ6_A1=I beg of you, please help!  Our leader is besieged by monsters in the catacombs under the Acropolis.  If he dies, then the rest of the world may suffer the same fate!  Please, go beneath the Parthenon – save him, quickly!
tagKyrosQ6_A2=The catacombs!  Please, they've gone after him!
tagKyrosQ6_A3=The Telkine summoned minions and sent them into the catacombs, then vanished, but I knew what they were after.  You can't let them break through that door!  
tagKyrosQ6_A4=Beneath the Parthenon, he's down there – At the bottom.  Please, you must stop them!
tagKyrosQ6_A7=The catacombs –  please, save him from the beasts!
tagKyrosQ6_B2=Thank you for saving Phaedrus!  Why didn't you speak with him?  Return to the catacombs.
tagKyrosQ6_B7=Please, go back and speak with Phaedrus.
tagAthens_Guard_A2=Kyros is almost mad with panic, but what he says seems to be true – dark magic conjured beasts upon the Acropolis.  We are fighting our way up there now.
tagtAthens_Guard_A7=There are storerooms and catacombs beneath the Acropolis.   You will find the entrance in the Parthenon.
tagPhaedrusQ6_A1=Mysterious warrior, by saving my life you have done more than you know.  I lead the Order of Prometheus in Athens.  We are an ancient order charged with the safe keeping of the mortal realm. {^n}{^n}What you have heard is true – the force behind these monsters is a powerful being, a lesser Titan known as a Telkine.  The Titans are an ancient race of gods, much older than Zeus and his brethren.  They once had absolute power, all creatures followed their rule.  Eventually the gods created humans and gifted us with intelligence.  We defied the Titans on many occasions, and they were determined to destroy us.  The gods resisted, refusing to let their greatest creation be destroyed, and a great war ensued.{^n}{^n}It seemed as though the Titans would triumph; however, a few bold warriors and heroes aided the gods.  They banished the Titans to a nether realm.  We believed that all the Telkines were banished with them.  It seems we were wrong. {^n}{^n}The Telkine is now bound for Knossos on the isle of Crete.  We fear that he plans to destroy a sacred artifact, which we have guarded for ages.  This artifact keeps us in contact with the godly realm.  If it is destroyed, there's no telling what will happen.  You have to stop him.  {^n}{^n}Go to the docks here in Athens.  You will find an agent of our Order who will arrange your passage to Crete.  Hurry.  The fate of the world is in your hands.
tagPhaedrusQ6_A2=The Order of Prometheus thanks you for your great service.  Do humankind one more, and stop the Telkine in Crete.
tagPhaedrusQ6_A3=Thank you, young warrior.  I see great promise in you.
tagPhaedrusQ6_A4=We must act quickly, there is no telling what will happen if the Telkine reaches this artifact.
tagPhaedrusQ6_A7=Please warrior, hurry.  You must stop the Telkine.
tagPhaedrusQ7_A2=The news, both sweet and bitter, has reached my ears.  I beg you, travel to Egypt.  There lives a member of the Order, a sage by the name of Imhotep.  If anyone will know how to repair the damage that has been done, it is he.
tagPhaedrusQ7_A7=Please – take the boat from the Knossos Landing to Rhakotis at the mouth of the Nile in Egypt.  There you will find Imhotep.
tagPhaedrusQ8_A2=I am glad Imhotep is well.  He is a wise man, and he knows a great deal about the connection between the gods and mortals.
tagPhaedrusQ8_A7=Let us all hope that Imhotep is not mistaken about this ceremony.
tagPhaedrusQ10_A2=For all the Order of Prometheus has done, a dark storm cloud hangs over our future.  We Prometheans will do what we can, but we are counting on you to stop the enemy.
tagPhaedrusQ10_A7=Be well, hero.  Our help will follow, though mostly in ways unseen by you – or the enemy.
tagAlalaQ7_A1=Phaedrus sent you?  You’re the one he is sending to Knossos?  Incredible!  {^n}{^n}I am the Promethian agent he spoke of.  Phaedrus knows what the Telkine did to my family, my village, and he still won’t let me seek my revenge.  Instead he sends you, while dispatching me on a mission to the east.  I am duty bound to follow his orders.  I hope Phaedrus knows what he is doing.  I suppose I wish you luck... I will see that Telkine dead one way or another.  I'll show you to your ship. 
tagAlalaQ7_A2=By right, this mission should be mine.
tagAlalaQ7_A3=I am bound east on other matters.
tagAlalaQ7_A4=This boat is as fast as any Greek vessel.
tagAlalaQ7_A7=We can set sail whenever you are ready.
tagAthens_Boatman_A1=This boat sails for Knossos, island of Crete.
tagAthens_Boatman_Yes=Come aboard then, we're set to sail.
tagAthens_Boatman_No=Come back when you're ready.
tagAlalaQ7_B7=Why have you come back from Knossos?  If you are not going to stop the Telkine – let me!
tagKnossos_Matron_A1=You seek the palace?  Be warned – tales speak of the minotaur beast who dwells in the labyrinth beneath the palace. You won't be going down there if you want to come up again!
tagKnossos_Matron_A2=The palace lies atop Tritons Ridge, but hear me, the minotaur is no old wives' tale!
tagKnossos_Matron_A3=Long ago, King Minos went afoul of a god.  At least that's how some tell it.  Well, much of no good took place, and in the end his wife bore a son with a bull's head! That was the first minotaur.
tagKnossos_Matron_A7=Through the fog you'll find the palace and the labyrinth.  A fool's errand, that is!
tagKnossos_Matron_B2=You survived the maze.  Well toss me in water and call me a fish!  I suppose you're some warrior now, aren't you?
tagKnossos_Matron_B3=But I was right, wasn't I?  Minotaurs were no old tale.
tagKnossos_Matron_B7=Killed a Minotaur!  They'll have a song of that in the tavern, soon enough.
tagKyrosQ7_A1=You – you destroyed him!  I saw it all from where I was hiding.  It was amazing!  I still can't believe that a mortal actually managed to best a Telkine!  Unfortunately, there was no way to stop him from destroying the conduit.  Now we are cut off from the gods.  They cannot hear our cries, and they cannot help us when we need them most.  If there is no way to reconnect the two realms, I fear that human-kind stands little chance against the monster scourge.  Please, go to Egypt.   Seek out a man named Imhotep, a sage of the Order of Prometheus.  He knows more about the nature of the conduit than any other mortal.  He may be our only hope.  You will find him in the city of Rhakotis.  Take my ship.  It is anchored at the river nearby.
tagKyrosQ7_A2=Travel quickly to Rhakotis, Imhotep will be expecting you.
tagKyrosQ7_A3=The ship is waiting, warrior, whenever you are ready.
tagKyrosQ7_A4=I did not think a mortal could slay a Telkine.  As amazed as I am, dread overwhelms me at the thought of the shattered conduit.
tagKyrosQ7_A5=I have other news.  Leonidas was successful in uniting the Greeks.  Although our ranks have increased, I do not believe we can win against this onslaught of monsters.  They seem to have a limitless supply of reinforcements.  We need the gods now more than ever. 
tagKyrosQ7_A7=You will find the boat at the docks beyond this passage.  I shall go back to closing my secret door.
tagKyrosQ8_A2=Did you speak with Imhotep?  Why have you come back to Greece?  You must help him re-establish our contact with the gods!
tagKyrosQ8_A7=You are needed in Egypt where Imhotep awaits.
tagKyrosQ10_A2=I am versed in many mysteries, but your tale of the invocation and Imhotep’s failure are most strange.   Warrior, you have killed one Telkine.  Let us hope you can defeat another!
tagKyrosQ10_A7=Fight bravely, hero.
tagKnossos_Boatman_A1=I have orders for passage to Egypt.  Ready to sail?
tagKnossos_Boatman_Yes=All aboard – port city of Rhakotis.
tagKnossos_Boatman_No=Well then, we'll sail when you give the word.
tagImhotepQ8_A1=Greetings traveler, I am Imhotep.  Honorable Phaedrus has praised your accomplishments and sent word of your coming.  Even the heroes of legend might have met their match in a Telkine.  Yet you have stood triumphant where others would have failed.{^n}{^n}Greece is not the only land plagued with monsters and other unnatural creatures.  Egypt is also in chaos; the Pharaoh has fled the palace and is now in hiding.  Entire armies cannot stop the monsters.  Without the gods, our cause is lost – death and slavery are our only future.{^n}{^n}I know a way we can contact the godly realm even though the conduit was destroyed.  There is an ancient invocation ceremony that might allow us to summon the gods.  You must go to the great library of Rhakotis and locate the Scroll of Invocation.  I must warn you to use caution as monsters have broken into the archives.  I cannot aid you in this task for I am no warrior.   {^n}{^n}I have pressing business in Sais.  Once you have obtained the scroll bring it to me there.  I will be in the Temple of Ptah.  All our hopes rest with you now.
tagImhotepQ8_A2=Go through the gates, the library shouldn't be hard to find. 
tagImhotepQ8_A3=The scroll describes an ancient invocation ceremony.  To the untutored eye it is worthless, but I how know to read the hidden meaning in its text.
tagImhotepQ8_A4=The Order of Prometheus gathers near the village of Sais, in the Temple of Ptah on the lower Nile.  I am needed there.
tagImhotepQ8_A5=Let us pray the Scroll of Invocation can bring our cries of despair to the gods. It must.  If not, all hope is lost.
tagImhotepQ8_A7=Find the scroll in the library and meet me in the Temple of Ptah.
tagRhakotis_Citizen1_A2=They blocked off the gate to keep the monsters out.  If you want to reach the library, you will have to find your way through the slums.
tagRhakotis_Citizen1_A7=The slums are dangerous, they are overrun...  but they are the only route to the library now.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_A1=Strange news travels the roads these days.  They say the monsters are nothing compared to what lies ahead.  There are whispers of an ancient sorcerer, powerful and cruel, who has come to our land.  Know what they call it?  Telkine, that is what.  They say it was here in Rhakotis and then headed up the Nile.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_A2=A Telkine has come... or so it is rumored.  Just that, no more.  But in these times, who can say?
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_A3=Have you heard of such a thing?  Heard of this ‘Telkine’?
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_A4=This plague of monsters is enough.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_A5=If you believe the gossip, this thing was here yesterday – it was here this morning!
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_A7=That is all I know.  I repeat what I hear, no more.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_B2=Everyday the rumors are different.  Today, the gods have abandoned us.  We are all lost.  Tomorrow, it will be a new god who wants to overthrow Aten-Ra.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_B3=Some say that Apep, enemy of the great god Ra, sank venomous teeth into his heel; now that our protector has fallen, Apep has turned the beasts on humankind.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_B4=Another man from the upper Nile claimed that the Pharaoh ordered a great mage killed for treachery, and this plague of beasts is the mage’s revenge.
tagRhakotis_Citizen2_B7=What do I think?  I think if we do not fight, soon there will be no tongues left for rumors!
tagRhakotis_Librarian_A1=I thank the gods that you are here!  I have done everything I could to keep the beasts from the library, but now these things are everywhere, even in our archives below.  These monsters are burning and destroying everything, with no respect for the knowledge our sacred scrolls hold.  Please stop them!
tagRhakotis_Librarian_A2=Yes, I am sure the scroll of which you speak is down there – if it hasn’t been burned or slashed to ribbons by those beasts!
tagRhakotis_Librarian_A3=We keep the scrolls below.  Somehow these monsters found their way in, I don’t know how.  They'll ruin everything!
tagRhakotis_Librarian_A7=The archives are down these stairs.  Be careful!
tagRhakotis_Librarian_B1=Warrior, we are in your debt.  Thanks to your help, we may recover a small portion of the library's priceless wisdom.  We may restore it to its former glory someday.  {^n}{^n}The fastest route to the Temple of Ptah is through a secret passage located deep in our archives.  I'm afraid the other exits from Rhakotis have been blocked.  
tagRhakotis_Librarian_B7=The secret passage is below the primary archives in the library vault.  It leads to the Hathor Basin, a stretch of desert bordering the Nile.
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_A1=Hail good hero!  Imhotep asked us to watch for you.  Just yesterday this temple stood whole and complete, and now – look!  It has been ransacked by a Telkine.  We did all we could to stop him, but we were powerless against the ancient sorcerer.  I do not know what he wanted.  There are many mysteries which the Order of Prometheus guards, mysteries from before the war of the gods and Titans.{^n}{^n}Imhotep fled when the Telkine came, escaping with some of the temple's most sacred texts.  He left me with a message for you: he has gone to Memphis and waits for you there.  Follow the Nile, and you will come to the great city.
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_A2=It was a strange and fearsome scene, I can tell you.  He had no interest in us – it seemed as if he were searching for something.  You can see for yourself how the Telkine left our temple!
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_A3=I don’t know what the Telkine was after.  I don’t think he found it though.  As quickly as he struck, he was gone again with the same speed.
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_A4=Imhotep was not hurt.  He is no warrior, his strength lies in his wisdom.  He will be in Memphis by now.  Meet him there.
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_A7=Imhotep is waiting for you in Memphis.  Travel up the Nile, and you will find that city.
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_B1=You found Imhotep?  Good.  I heard what you are doing is of great importance to the Order.
tagAbedju_SecretosGuard_B7=Good luck in your journey.  
tagImhotepQ8_B1=I am relieved to see you.  Things have not gone well.  We were horribly unprepared to battle a  powerful Telkine.  No one has seen one since the war between the Titans and the gods, but now they seem to be everywhere!  It is more important than ever that we proceed with the invocation ceremony.  Only the gods can protect us.  {^n}{^n}Thank you for retrieving the Scroll of Invocation.  Now let me see… to complete the Ritual of Invocation we must first collect the Eye of Chaos and the Hand of Balance.  The Eye is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Fayum Oasis.  I believe the Hand of Balance is in Giza. {^n}{^n}Recover these artifacts and bring them to me.  Only then can we summon the gods.  Be on your guard!  In these times, peril lurks at every turn.
tagImhotepQ8_B1_Alt=I am relieved to see you.  Things have not gone well.  We were horribly unprepared to battle a  powerful Telkine.  No one has seen one since the war between the Titans and the gods, but now they seem to be everywhere!  It is more important than ever that we proceed with the invocation ceremony.  Only the gods can protect us.  {^n}{^n}Now let me see… to complete the Ritual of Invocation we must first collect the Eye of Chaos and the Hand of Balance.  The Eye is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Fayum Oasis.  I believe the Hand of Balance is in Giza. {^n}{^n}Recover these artifacts and bring them to me.  Only then can we summon the gods.  Be on your guard!  In these times, peril lurks at every turn.
tagImhotepQ8_B2=I am afraid I know no more about the location of these artifacts than I have told you.  The Hand of Balance is thought to be somewhere in Giza, perhaps in the pyramid or the Great Sphinx.  The Eye of Chaos should be somewhere near the Fayum Oasis.  Seek these artifacts and return to me.
tagImhotepQ8_B7=Travel to Giza and the Fayum Oasis.  Bring back the Eye of Chaos and the Hand of Balance.  It is vital that we invoke the gods, for they are our only hope.
tagImhotepQ8_C7=Excellent.  Now bring me the other artifact, and we can begin the invocation ceremony.
tagOasis_Villager1_A1=Greetings, traveler.  We haven't seen many new faces here, lately.  I don't know about any ancient artifacts – the only thing ancient around here is the desert.  There's the Temple of Osiris, just outside the walls here.  Be warned, it was attacked last night by monsters.  Now... hold a minute.  I have heard of another temple, ancient, from the days of the first Pharaohs.  It was built into a cliff far off in the desert.  But it is only a legend.  No one has seen it –  it might not exist!
tagOasis_Villager1_A2=I heard that the Temple of Osiris was attacked, but I did not see it with my own eyes.
tagOasis_Villager1_A3=That old temple – I am sure it is just a rumor, a myth.  But if it did exist, it must be far off, deep in the desert. 
tagOasis_Villager1_A4=Fayum – a great oasis.  Around it gather people, merchants, camels... then shops, walls, caravans.  Out here in the desert, water is life – water is gold.
tagOasis_Villager1_A7=I do not know how much damage the monsters did to the Temple of Osiris, but you'll find it just outside the town.  No one knows where to find this fabled desert temple, or even what it was called.  If it exists!
tagOasis_Villager1_B2=It was not a rumor?  The temple was real?  I was sure it was no more than a legend.
tagOasis_Villager1_B7=Sometimes legends are true, then.
tagOasis_Secreto_A1=You're the one from Greece, aren't you, the one who killed the Telkine!  Would you believe it – a Telkine was here.  A Telkine did this.  Just yesterday, these pillars were standing and whole.  I have guarded this Promethian temple from thieves and desert beasts, but I was powerless against the Telkine.  In truth, I was lucky to escape alive.
tagOasis_Secreto_A2=Whether the Telkine was taking revenge on the Order of Prometheus or searching for something, I cannot say.  He destroyed much, as you can see; went through the whole temple, then left.
tagOasis_Secreto_A3=I haven't heard of this Eye of Chaos.  You might try asking around in Fayum.
tagOasis_Secreto_A4=I heard that the Telkine struck the Temple of Ptah near Sais as well.  Both were guarded by the Order of Prometheus.
tagOasis_Secreto_A5=The Prometheans kept many ancient and precious artifacts here but none were called the Eye of Chaos.
tagOasis_Secreto_A7=Good luck on your quest.  I am afraid to learn what dark business this Telkine has in Egypt.
tagGiza_Caretaker_A7=Not in tombs among the riches, no.  Not there.  The Balanced Hand is a riddle, yes, a prize beneath a cold stone paw.
tagImhotepQ9_B1=Ah, the Eye of Chaos and the Hand of Balance.  They combine to form the Scepter of Eternity, an artifact of great power.  Now, let us make haste and perform the ceremony. 
tagImhotepQ9_A1=Why this – this cannot be!  How could we fail?  All that we’ve tried to accomplish has been in vain!  It is clear to me that the gods cannot help us.  We are now truly on our own. {^n}{^n}We must never stop trying.  The Telkine that has been rampaging through Egypt has ravaged a number of sites guarded by the Order of Prometheus.  These sites hold powerful artifacts from the ancient war; clearly the Telkine is looking for something.  Because of the artifacts' mysterious powers, we of the Order have guarded the hidden sites for thousands of years.  Now there is only one site that has gone untouched in all of Egypt.  In my blindness, I ignored all this because I thought the gods would save us.  I was truly a fool. {^n}{^n}You must go to the Tomb of Ramses, the last site in the Valley of the Kings.   Head up the Nile to Thebes and from there to the Valley and the Tomb.  Look for signs of the Telkine’s passage.  Whatever he’s searching for must not fall into his hands.  When you have accomplished this task, meet me in Thebes. {^n}{^n}Now that we cannot count on the gods to save humanity, we must count on our heroes. Go now!
tagImhotepQ9_A2=I was a fool... I put all my faith in help from the gods – but it was not to be.  I only hope it is not too late.
tagImhotepQ9_A3=Had you not already slain a Telkine, I would say all is lost.  All hope rides on you now.
tagImhotepQ9_A7=Go, warrior.  Stop the Telkine, then look for me in Thebes.
tagThebes_Theban1_A1=Hail warrior!  How did you get here alive?  The monsters have been killing everyone along the roads!{^n}{^n}I saw a large group of monsters  being led by a terrible sorcerer who reeked of dark power; it must have been the Telkine.  He was a terrifying sight.  They forced their way through this temple, then past that gate, towards the Valley of the Kings.
tagThebes_Theban1_A2=This thing, this 'Telkine', if that's what you call it, came through here.  I was terrified it would stop and kill us all.
tagThebes_Theban1_A3=I am not a coward, but my heart quailed in my chest when I saw them.
tagThebes_Theban1_A4=The Valley of the Kings?  That is where the tombs of many Pharaohs lie, carved into rock.
tagThebes_Theban1_A7=Follow the Telkine? Are you mad? Through the open gate, follow the Highland Pass.  But only a fool would go there.
tagThebes_Theban1_B7=I saw the beasts head down the path, toward the Valley of the Kings.  Where they went next, I do not know.
tagThebes_Theban1_C2=Stranger!  Stranger!  An aged priest entered Thebes not long ago asking of your whereabouts.  He went by the name Imhotep, and he was quite impatient to find you.
tagThebes_Theban1_C7=The old priest was looking everywhere for you.  Whatever he had to say, it must have been important.
tagThebes_Theban1_D7=The Temple of Hatshepsut is not this way.
tagVoK_SecretosGuard_A2=Amazing that you managed to defeat that Telkine.  You are indeed a warrior worthy of song.{^n}{^n}I was sent by Imhotep.  He is in Thebes now and has urgent news.
tagVoK_SecretosGuard_A7=Imhotep is in Thebes.  Seek him there.
tagImhotepQ10_A1=You defeated the Telkine?  Excellent!  Perhaps there is hope yet.  You must get to Babylon – even now another Telkine is assaulting that city!{^n}{^n}What is this tablet that you found?  Let me take a look at it.  Hmmm… Oh no!  I know now what these Telkine were looking for.  This tablet reveals that within the Temple of Marduk, below the Hanging Gardens, rests the Sickle of Kronos.  This sickle was used by the Titans in the great war and possesses the power to kill even a god.  If this sickle is at the Telkines’ command, we are all doomed.  Hurry, it is most important that you get to Babylon right away!{^n}{^n}There is no time to go by land or boat... there may be a better way.  Go to the temple of Hatshepsut where you will find an ancient portal.  The Scepter of Eternity is a key to many realms and can be used with the portal to transport you to Babylon.  Place the scepter before the portal and walk through.  Go with all speed – we may already be too late.
tagImhotepQ10_B1=There, the gates are open.  Go, hero, or I fear to think what will befall us!
tagImhotepQ10_B2=When you reach the portal, use the scepter.
tagImhotepQ10_B3=What we do not know is whether this third Telkine knows of the sickle.  We must hope he does not.
tagImhotepQ10_B7=Find the portal in the Temple of Hatshepsut.  The Scepter of Eternity will open the way to Babylon.  Go with all possible speed!
tagImhotepQ10_C1=You defeated the Telkine?  Excellent!  Perhaps there is hope yet.  You must get to Babylon – even now another Telkine is assaulting that city!{^n}{^n}Describe this tablet that you found.  Ahh... I know now what these Telkine were looking for.  This tablet reveals that within the temple of Marduk, below the Hanging Gardens, rests the Sickle of Kronos.  This sickle was used by the Titans in the great war and possesses the power to kill even a god.  If this sickle is at the Telkines’ command, we are all doomed.  Hurry, it is most important that you get to Babylon right away!{^n}{^n}There is no time to go by land or boat...  there may be a better way.  Go to the temple of Hatshepsut where you will find an ancient portal.  The Scepter of Eternity is a key to many realms and can be used with the portal to instantly transport you to Babylon. Place the scepter before the portal and walk through.  Go with all speed – we may already be too late.
tagImhotepQ11_A2=The third Telkine – ahead of you?  Is it too late?  Hurry.  You must stop him!
tagImhotepQ11_A7=Hurry.  You must stop him!
tagImhotepQ11_B2=He took the sickle?  And Feiyan was there?  Go back, talk to her and find out what happened!
tagImhotepQ11_B7=Feiyan must have seen it all.  Talk to her!
tagImhotepQ11_C1=The sickle – gone!  After all we have worked for… yet, it is true.   There is hope so long as we fight.  If you can follow this Telkine, maybe there is the slightest glimmer of hope that we can stop it in its mission.
tagImhotepQ11_C2=Yes, the chances are slim, but when have they been otherwise?  Hero, the Telkine has gone eastward.  Track it, follow it, and stop it if you can.
tagImhotepQ11_C7=If the Telkine went east, so should you, hero.  There may still be hope!
tagImhotepQ12_A2=Well, hero, it is good to see your face.  I am afraid I may be of no more use to you.  The enemy is in the east, and that is where you should be.
tagImhotepQ12_A7=I cannot help you now, but the Order of Prometheus is at work everywhere, even when not seen.
tagImhotepQ14_A2=Typhon!  The sickle!  Of course, why didn’t I realize before.  Without action, mortal wisdom can be as blind as the beggar in the market.
tagImhotepQ14_A7=Of course, foreknowledge of the Telkines' plan would not have helped us stop them.  You must stop them now!
tagImhotepQ15_A7=Olympus?!  What are you doing here?  Hurry, Typhon must be stopped!
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_A1=By Inanna!  I thought the portals were a myth.  How did you get it to work?  But never mind that right now.  You say that Imhotep sent you?  It is good to hear the Order is still fighting in the land of the pharaohs.  I just hope you are in time.  A Telkine is forcing his way into the sacred chamber in the Temple of Marduk.  It was guarded by the Order of Prometheus, and we have all but lost the battle.  Hurry, warrior.  You must stop him from breaching the sealed chamber.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_A2=Go – hurry! 
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_A3=There's no time to spare.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_A4=Just find your way to the top.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_A5=The Temple of Marduk lies atop the Hanging Gardens.  Let us hope the Telkine has not reached the sickle.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_A7=Hurry!
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_B1=The sickle, gone?  This is terrible.  But why did you not speak with Feiyan?  She must have seen what happened there.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_B7=Go – go speak with Feiyan.  Surely she saw what happened.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_C1=The Telkine knocked her aside, then took the sickle... If Feiyan was injured, it is up to you to follow the Telkine.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_C2=I hope she is alright.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_C3=Too late! But we must never give up hope – you have slayed a Telkine before, I believe you can do it again!
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_C4=She was right, it is now up to you to follow the Telkine.
tagBabylon_SecretosGuard_C7=You must follow the Telkine and stop him.
tagAlalaQ11_A1=I have failed.  All my life I trained so that I might one day kill a monster like this Telkine, but when the time came I was not strong enough to defeat him.  I fell on the first blow,  powerless to move.  Now because of my failure, he has the Sickle of Kronos. {^n}{^n}Can what you say be true?  You managed to beat the Telkines in Crete and in Egypt?  Thank you, warrior.  At least in some way my family and village have been avenged.  At last they can rest in peace.  I see now I misjudged you and your abilities when we first met.  {^n}{^n}Now that the Telkine wields the sickle, his power matches that of the gods.  There is no telling what terrible purpose he has planned.  Hurry!  He used the sickle to slash an exit through the wall.  Don't worry about me, follow him.  Go!

tagAlalaQ11_A2=You must track the Telkine.  It's our last hope.
tagAlalaQ11_A3=With the sickle, the Telkine possesses insurmountable power.  He must be stopped!
tagAlalaQ11_A4=I thought, because I was faster... the element of surprise... but he tossed me back as if I were nothing.
tagAlalaQ11_A7=Go, warrior.  I am not important.  Track down that ancient sorcerer and kill him.
tagBabylon_Farmer2_A1=I did see this thing you speak of...  a horde of monsters and their leader held a terrible weapon.  They came this way, slashing and burning everything in their path.  Anyone who didn't flee was cut down.
tagBabylon_Farmer2_A2=The weapon it held high was like a sickle… but such a thing no man has ever reaped his harvest with.  Surely, it was made to harvest the lives of men!
tagBabylon_Farmer2_A3=In the ancient legends, in the tales the priests tell, never have I heard of something as horrible as what I saw.
tagBabylon_Farmer2_A4=He swung the sickle and clove a tree in half!
tagBabylon_Farmer2_A7=Just as I said, he went that way, towards Parthia, where the Silk Road begins.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler1_A1=A 'thing' came this way, holding a giant sickle.  And following it, strange beasts like a swarm of insects.  They came like rolling death and then moved on.  I wonder what terrible purpose they move East for…
tagSilkRoad_Traveler1_A2=I don't trust my eyes – did they come as an army, or did they crawl out of the shadows of the woods, drawn by some mysterious force?
tagSilkRoad_Traveler1_A3=Yes, this way is the Silk Road, which traders travel to reach the eastern lands.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler1_A7=The monster that you track went that way, down the Silk Road.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler2_A1=Follow it?  That thing with the great blade?  Sounds like a fool's errand, but if you're set on it, it is no harder than following the Silk Road.  Of course the path is treacherous, especially this time of year.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler2_A2=Know anything about the monsters in these parts? You should. They're larger and fiercer, for one. Strange creatures, like the raptors. Then there are the neanderthal tribes – and of course, the yeti.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler2_A3=Many narrow passes covered in snow on the road ahead. The going can be treacherous.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler2_A4=The people who live up here generally keep peace with the neanderthal tribes – and sometimes they don't.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler2_A5=Amdo is the northern region of the Shangshung, the mountain folk.  Farther east they are known as the Banpo.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler2_A7=If you are fast enough, and you are not scared, you might catch up with that thing that wields the sickle.  Just follow the path.
tagSilkRoad_Villager1_A2=The neanderthals are big, but yeti are larger. Larger than that, far to the east, is a giant lying beneath a mountain.
tagSilkRoad_Villager1_A7=My mother scared me with that story when I was small.
tagSilkRoad_Villager2_A2=Have you seen a yeti?  I went once through the Chumbi Valley into the ice caverns.  I saw a yeti there larger than any other!  Maybe this is what the old tales mean when they talk of a giant beneath a mountain in the east.
tagSilkRoad_Villager2_A7=It was enormous! I ran home after that.
tagGreatWall_Soldier1_A1=Hail, traveler!  Before you lies the great wall that shields our land from barbarian hordes.  It has never failed us before, but yesterday before dawn, an army of beasts overran us and passed into the mainland.  We have seen these beasts before but not in such number.  It was truly a terrible sight!  We still struggle to clear the wall.
tagGreatWall_Soldier1_A2=Our watchmen say they saw a fearsome creature armed with a curved blade leading the army.
tagGreatWall_Soldier1_A3=The worst of the monster plague had passed, we thought – but that was just the calm before the storm!
tagGreatWall_Soldier1_A4=The monstrous horde came upon us as if from nowhere. We were unprepared and lost many men.
tagGreatWall_Soldier1_A7=We have not yet secured the wall.
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_A1=Our orders are to clear the wall, but these peng aren't making it easy.  A giant one has taken up by the guard tower over there.  The men won't fight it – we'll just have to wait for reinforcements.
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_A2=It's bigger and stronger than ten peng.  It picked up our captain and threw him into the woods!
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_A3=What good is a wall when you're fighting winged monsters!
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_A4=The commander will be waiting for us on the other side.   But what can we do?
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_A5=We thought our woes were over when the monster army passed through.  Oh, we've been cursed with evil fates!
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_A7=We don't dare go on; a giant peng is blocking the way.
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_B1=You – you beat the giant peng?  It brushed off a dozen of our best men like flies!  Well, I thank you, warrior.  Please bring word to the commander that we will soon have the wall cleared.
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_B2=Tell me, please – how did you defeat it?
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_B3=Please, take me as your student.  I wish to become as great a warrior as you are!
tagGreatWall_Soldier4_B7=Clearly, you are a great hero!
tagGreatWall_Guard1_A1=Thank you for your aid, warrior.  A mighty being came through here wielding a weapon of terrible destructive power.  If I were you, I'd talk to some of the villagers in town.  One of them may know where the beast went.  For the time being, the village down below should be safe.  
tagGreatWall_Guard1_A2=A fearsome being did come this way, wielding a great curved blade.  If I were you, I'd talk to some of the villagers in Zhidan.  It's not far.  Some of them must have seen which way it went.
tagGreatWall_Guard1_A7=Ask in Zhidan Village.  Perhaps the people there saw where it went.
tagGreatWall_Guard1_B2=The fearsome beast got to Chang'an and disappeared? Maybe it decided to go home. Ha! These are strange times, indeed.
tagGreatWall_Guard1_B7=I'll count my fortunes if it doesn't come back this way.
tagGreatWall_Guard1_C1=So Zi Chan's patrol is making progress?  Excellent.  I am glad to hear our men are handling things.
tagGreatWall_OldVillager_A1=We saw this Telkine you speak of.  It carried a great sickle, and those cursed beasts thronged around it.  We watched it come from the Great Wall and disappear into the Jingyang woods, in the direction of Chang'an.
tagGreatWall_OldVillager_A2=There are rumors that the Emperor already left the Chang'an Palace, and that monsters have broken down the walls.  Who can say what is true?
tagGreatWall_OldVillager_A3=You could see the great sickle from far off – held aloft – like a beacon, like a weapon.
tagGreatWall_OldVillager_A7=The road beyond our gates leads through Jingyang woods to Chang'an, the imperial city. 
tagGreatWall_OldVillager_B7=Cannot find the Telkine?  Not in Jingyang Woods, and not in Chang'an either?  Well, it went that way.
tagChangan_Woman_A1=Warrior, warrior!  Listen to me.  A woman asked me to look out for one like you.  She waits in the center of the city, this city, Chang'an.  But have you heard the news?  Chaos runs wild in the streets.  The Great Emperor's terra cotta soldiers have come to life.  They have left the mausoleum and are terrorizing the city!
tagChangan_Woman_A2=The woman asked if I had seen a foreign warrior and gave me gold to watch for you.  Go into the city.  She waits for you.
tagChangan_Woman_A3=How can clay soldiers come to life?  Some powerful magic is being used, I am sure of it.
tagChangan_Woman_A4=They say the lord of the beasts entered our land recently.  They say he came holding a great, gleaming sickle!
tagChangan_Woman_A5=I don't know who the woman was, but clearly she knew of your coming.
tagChangan_Woman_A7=She waits for you in the city.  Go now and find her.
tagChangan_Woman_B1=You found her?  Good. There is no need to thank me.
tagChangan_Woman_B2=Chang'an is the Imperial City, founded by the Great Emperor when he unified our land.
tagChangan_Woman_B3=The diviners and fortune-readers foretold some dark event, but we never expected this.
tagChangan_Woman_B7=May fortune find you, warrior.
tagChangan_Woman_C2=Chang'an is the Imperial City, founded by the Great Emperor when he unified our land.
tagChangan_Woman_C3=The diviners and fortune-readers foretold some dark event, but we never expected this.
tagChangan_Woman_C7=May fortune find you, warrior.
tagChangan_Woman_D2=You were able to defeat the clay soldiers?  Amazing!  Maybe there is hope.
tagChangan_Woman_D7=Amazing!
tagAlalaQ12_A1=Hail champion!  I only just arrived by boat, back in my own land once again.  Word has spread that you have traveled the whole length of the Silk Road pursuing the Telkine.  The Telkine arrived in this city not long ago but now seems to have mysteriously vanished.  Many of our Order are out looking for him, but he has yet to be found. {^n}{^n} Our scholars have been studying our most ancient scrolls to find out why the Telkine came here.  It seems that the last Titan defeated in the great war was not banished by the gods with his brethren, but was imprisoned here on earth!  And the texts say he is here in this region!  Our greatest fear is that the Telkine has come to free him. {^n}{^n}If we are to have any chance of stopping the Telkine, you must journey to the mystical Jade Palace and speak with the Yellow Emperor.  If he can be found, he will know the whereabouts of this Titan.  Our scholars found passages of an epic poem that describe the Jade Palace as being on a white mountain.  They believe the ‘white mountain’ is Mount Qiyun, located to the west beyond the Jinghe Valley.  It is said only the most worthy may visit the Palace. Good luck.

tagAlalaQ12_A2=Emperor Huang-ti, the Yellow Emperor, was a great Chinese hero and scholar.  After performing many great deeds, he went to live in his Jade Palace, which we think is high on Qiyun Mountain, across the Jinghe Valley. There he long contemplated life and found the secret to immortality.  Since then he has spent his endless days in contemplation of the nature of the universe.  It is said that he made his wisdom like his palace, available for all who are worthy to find it.
tagAlalaQ12_A3=I wish I could help you with this task… but I realize I cannot.  My quest has become yours.  It is up to you now.  And there is no one I would trust more.
tagAlalaQ12_A7=If we are right, you must move quickly and find the Yellow Emperor in his palace atop Qiyun Mountain.  Good luck.
tagChangan_GateGuard_A2=Sorry!  This gate's closed. There are too many monsters on the other side.
tagChangan_GateGuard_A7=We cannot open the gate; it is our last line of defense.
tagChangan_GateGuard_B2=The Forest of the Ancients lies to the east.  Great danger lies beyond these walls, monsters pound on this very gate.  If you insist I shall unlock the doors.  I hope you know what you're getting yourself into!
tagChangan_GateGuard_B7=Go ahead, open the gate.  Don't say I didn't warn you!
tagChangan_GateGuard_C7=You let the monsters in, you deal with them!
tagChangan_GateGuard_D2=I'm going to ask to get reassigned to record-keeping. This job is too dangerous!
tagChangan_GateGuard_D7=See, I told you it was a bad idea.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A1=Worthy traveler, welcome to the Jade Palace.  I have been here without company for many years and would enjoy the delight of a conversation with you on matters of philosophy.  But sadly we have no time for this, as a shadow has swept across the land.{^n}{^n}You have slain two Telkine already – quite an accomplishment!  But stopping the third will be far more difficult.  If you do not stop him, he will surely free Typhon.  Our existence is threatened.  The gods won their war with the Titans only through surprise and deceit.  However, their tricks will not work a second time.  The gods banished all the Titans, except one.  In their hubris, they imprisoned the one they hated the most, Typhon, under a mountain.  He was eternally chained to that which he wanted to rule but could never possess.  Now the gods' hubris may be their downfall.{^n}{^n}Typhon is imprisoned under Wusao Mountain, not far from Chang'an.  If you hurry, you may be able to stop the Telkine from freeing his master.  Take the passage below my chamber.  The challenges ahead of you are more treacherous than those faced by any mortal.  The future of humanity rests on your shoulders.{^n}{^n} May your skill and wisdom be armor against the challenges you face.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A2=From here, I contemplate our mortal world. Thus, ever clear and seeing, I was aware of your progress and awaited your arrival.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A3=The gods chained this Titan beneath the mountain.  There is grave danger.   If he is freed, he may return to repay their cruelty.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A4=The lives of mortals pass like water in a stream.  I have come to dwell by the source of all streams.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A5=Hurry.  The Titan's servant nears his master.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A6=In my youth I was one of the warriors who fought beside the gods against the Titans.  I was said to be a hero for slaying so many monsters, but even I would not dare to stand against the might of a Titan alone.  So, you see, it is imperative that you stop this Telkine before he frees Typhon.
tagYellowEmperorQ13_A7=Take the passage which leads below my palace.  Seek Wusao Mountain, young hero.
tagYellowEmperorQ14_A2=Warrior, your task is not here.  Return to Wusao. The world depends on you!
tagYellowEmperorQ14_A7=Go now.  Return to Wusao.
tagYellowEmperorQ15_A2=Hero, you must not hesitate.  Follow Typhon through the portal.  There you will decide the world's fate.
tagYellowEmperorQ15_A7=Go through the portal and meet your destiny. 
tagAlalaQ14_A1=You found the Jade Palace?  Amazing.  You are truly an epic hero worthy of all the poets.  It was thought that the Yellow Emperor was just a legend.  No one living had ever seen him. {^n}{^n}Wusao Mountain is not far from here.  Find the gate that leads to the Forest of the Ancients.  Beyond the forest, I hope you will find the Titan's prison.{^n}{^n}Wait!  Before you go... I know I did not treat you well when we first met, despite saving me from humiliating imprisonment.  I am truly sorry.  After all you have done, I am glad to have known you.  Please do not let the deaths of our brethren be in vain.  All my hopes, and the hopes of all humanity, go with you.
tagAlalaQ14_A3=Good luck... I don't know if it means much, but my thoughts will be with you.
tagAlalaQ14_A4=Others will sing of your deeds, but I will remember you as you are now and how lucky I was to meet you.
tagAlalaQ14_A5=A gate in Chang'an opens onto the Forest of the Ancients.  Beyond this forest lies Wusao Mountain.
tagAlalaQ14_A7=Go. Go now, and stop the Telkine from freeing Typhon!
tagAlalaQ14_B2=You must face the enemy.  No one else can.
tagAlalaQ14_B7=Go. My thoughts will be with you.
tagAlalaQ14_C1=The realm of the gods!  How many mortal eyes have seen such a sight?  If you do not stop Typhon, I fear that no one will.
tagAlalaQ14_C7=So much depends on you!  Fight bravely.
tagYellowEmperorApparitionQ15_A2=Hero, you must make haste.  The Titan is wreaking havoc on the gods in Olympus.  You must hurry!  Follow him through the portal and stop this destruction!
tagYellowEmperorApparitionQ15_A7=Hurry, step through the portal!
tagZeusQ15_A1=Hail, mighty hero!  I am Zeus, king of the Olympian gods.  We are eternally thankful for your aid in stopping Typhon.  No one thought that a human could defeat a Titan.  The epic heroes would kneel before you.{^n}{^n}Perhaps it is best that the conduit between our realms was destroyed.  For now I see that men are ready to become the masters of their own fate.  From this time forth, humanity's destiny shall lie in the hands of its people – and its heroes.
tagStarting_Shepherd1_A1=We were leading our flocks home when a pack of satyrs attacked.  By the gods, they grabbed Tellis and dragged him into a roadside cave.  The roads aren't safe – nowhere is safe, anymore.
tagStarting_Shepherd1_A2=First the satyrs lurked in the woods, then in the open fields.  Now they roam like impudent brigands on our roads.
tagStarting_Shepherd1_A3=How have we offended the gods that they send this scourge of monsters on us?
tagStarting_Shepherd1_A4=They jumped out at us and grabbed him, by Zeus!  I am sure I lost him.
tagStarting_Shepherd1_A5=You won't find me straying from the village again.
tagStarting_Shepherd1_A7=It is too dangerous to leave the village.  Soon I fear they will be dragging us from our very houses to their cookpot.
tagStarting_Shepherd1_B2=Tellis, still alive?  I can hardly believe my ears!  I had given up.  Thank you, warrior!  Thank you!
tagStarting_Shepherd1_B7=You saved the life of my friend.  Zeus bring you good fortune.
tagStarting_Shepherd2_A1=A human face?  Good fortune finds me even in the darkest places of Greece.  I believed I was counting my final hours.  
tagStarting_Shepherd2_A2=I am Tellis.  Nicostratus made it back to the village?  So he's alright, then?  We tended our flocks together.  We are close like brothers.
tagStarting_Shepherd2_A3=These creatures live like savages – fighting and snarling amongst themselves.
tagStarting_Shepherd2_A7=If you see Nicostratus before I do, tell him I'll be along.  I think I need to gather my nerves first.
tagStarting_Lumberjack_A1=Thank you.  I was in a bit of a scrape there, I’ll admit.  Thank the god Hermes you came along.
tagStarting_Lumberjack_A2=You know, the satyrs have always been there, deep in the woods.  But they were shy of humans and never so savage as this.
tagStarting_Lumberjack_A3=I don’t know when the rumors started.  First a man was attacked.  Then strange beasts were seen by moonlight.  Whispers of centaurs, harpies...  And then, suddenly, they were upon us.
tagStarting_Lumberjack_A4=It’s madness!  A curse from some god we have offended.  These beasts are brazen, they roam at will.
tagStarting_Lumberjack_A5=This was my home.  The beasts attacked and set fire to everything I owned.  A few minutes more and they would have had my life as well!
tagStarting_Lumberjack_A7=Thank you for your help.  May the goddess Athena keep you safe.
tagStarting_Lumberjack_B7=Help me!
tagStarting_Traveler_A1=Traveler, please you must assist me!  A strange illness afflicts many in my town of Tegea and I was sent to retrieve medicines.  I have them in my cart  but now the pass ahead is held by satyrs, led by one of their fierce champions.
tagStarting_Traveler_A2=Without this medicine many in Tegea will perish.  If I don't find a way to get back soon, there may be none left to welcome me home.
tagStarting_Traveler_A3=News of satyrs and even stranger beasts is spreading across the land.  It seems every town or village has a story, and I've heard the Spartan forces are on the march.
tagStarting_Traveler_A7=If you could clear the pass ahead I would be forever grateful.  If not I will have to try and force my way, though I fear that will be a most unpleasant ending.
tagStarting_Traveler_B1=The way is clear?  Good!  Well, I'll be moving on I suppose.  Here, have this for your troubles.
tagStarting_Traveler_B7=Now I can make the journey to Tegea.
tagSparta_BrideFather_A1=I know it's dangerous here, but I can't go home.  My daughter was supposed to be married.  Alas, her dowry, a fine gold necklace, is in the claws of crazed demons who smashed my cart and ran off.
tagSparta_BrideFather_A2=I'm no rich man.  That necklace was all I had to give.
tagSparta_BrideFather_A3=How can I go home?  What would I tell my daughter?
tagSparta_BrideFather_A4=It was dark.  The monsters seized my mount, with the bags on its back, and dragged it off the road.  They couldn’t have gone far.
tagSparta_BrideFather_A5=I would go after the beasts myself, but what could I do?  I'm no warlike Spartan.
tagSparta_BrideFather_A7=How can I get back the dowry?   How could I return home without it?  
tagSparta_BrideFather_B1=The necklace!  Oh, may the goddess Hera bless you!  
tagSparta_BrideFather_B2=My daughter will have her dowry now, thanks to you.  We'll start preparations and in three days – the wedding!  Bless you, stranger.
tagSparta_BrideFather_B3=I wonder, if these strange beasts do not go away, how many weddings will we have?  How many will be ruined?
tagSparta_BrideFather_B7=Thank you!  Thank you.
tagSparta_BrideFather_C2=Like swift-moving storm clouds, the monsters arrived suddenly and turned mortal life fearful and dark.  Now men die before their time, marriages are broken, and harvests are left in the field!
tagSparta_BrideFather_C7=Woe for these dark times!  My daughter cannot be married, our dowry is lost!
tagSparta_WorriedSoldier_A2=If I look worried it's because Hippias, an ancient of war and a father figure to me, wandered off into the valley this morning and has not come back.  He is getting old and thinks he still has his former strength and speed.
tagSparta_WorriedSoldier_A7=To be honest, it is not safe for any man alone out there.  Centaurs and other beasts wander the valley.
tagSparta_WorriedSoldier_B1=Hippias was okay?  Just standing there?  Well, I should have known better than to worry about old Hippias.  Here, take this for your trouble.
tagSparta_WorriedSoldier_B2=Old Hippias was the most feared warrior of his time.  At a tenth of his strength, it seems he's still more a warrior than some men.
tagSparta_WorriedSoldier_B7=Thank you, stranger.  I'll worry for the old man no more.
tagSparta_Hippias_A1=What's that?  I can't hear you, young man.  Speak up! 
tagSparta_Hippias_A2=Hippias is my name.  I've trained as a Spartan warrior since I was younger than you.
tagSparta_Hippias_A3=You should be careful, young traveler.  This valley is full of deadly centaurs.
tagSparta_Hippias_A4=I was taking a morning stroll when I came across these monsters.  When I was done with them, I thought I would rest awhile.
tagSparta_Hippias_A7=I'm quite alright.  No need to worry about old Hippias. 
tagSparta_PineVillager_A2=The water by our village has gone foul.  It happened just the day before last, after the first satyr was spotted.  My sister got sick and then my neighbor.
tagSparta_PineVillager_A7=With the village spring tainted, we will have to travel far for fresh water.  Unfortunately the roads are just as dangerous as our poisoned water!
tagSparta_PineVillager_B7=The naiad, sick?  This is very bad.  
tagSparta_PineVillager_C2=Thanks to you, the spring is clean and good for drinking.  All in the village will be grateful.  
tagSparta_PineVillager_C7=Thank you, stranger.  May the gods grant you fortune always!
tagSparta_Naiad_A1=Mortal I am a naiad, the spirit of this spring.  Pegaea I am called.  My water has been tainted and I am ill.  Vile spiders have come to dwell in a cave by my water's source.  They are the cause of the poison.
tagSparta_Naiad_A2=A naiad is a water spirit.  That is what I am.  Not everything that is unhuman has been touched by this plague of madness.
tagSparta_Naiad_A3=If the spiders are not destroyed, I will grow weaker – or worse, I will become foul and corrupted in my nature.
tagSparta_Naiad_A7=As long as the spiders continue to poison this spring, I will be sick, and sicken those who drink from me.  Find the source of these waters and you will find the spiders.
tagSparta_Naiad_B2=You have cleansed the poison from the cave.  My waters will run clear and clean again.
tagSparta_Naiad_B7=Thank you, stranger.
tagCoastal_Citizen1_A2=We've got troubles.  Every part of Greece is troubled these days.  Sure, the centaurs and the satyrs are bad, but for us, the walking dead are worse.  Every night they're at the city walls.  We wake to more farmland burned and cattle slain...  
tagCoastal_Citizen1_A7=The dead raise their hand against the living, and still the gods do not hear our prayers!
tagCoastal_Citizen1_B1=I don't know whether to believe you, stranger... The skeletons sent back to their graves where they belong?  I thought hope had fled the Grecian lands.
tagCoastal_Citizen1_B2=Warrior, if you stood and fought the undead, we should all take heart!  Does dawn ever fail to follow night?
tagCoastal_Citizen1_B7=Fortune follow you, stranger, wherever you go.
tagCoastal_Citizen2_A1=Everyone's talking about the undead, the living bones that attack us.  Many in Megara whisper rumors, but I know the truth.  I know where they come from…
tagCoastal_Citizen2_B2=Everyone's talking about the undead, the living bones that attack us.  Many in Megara whisper rumors, but I know the truth.  I know where they come from…  I crept out one night just before dawn and followed quietly.  There is a ruined city built by the Mycenaeans long ago that we call Old Eleusis.  It was there they went.  There I followed them and watched them pour into the old stone gates.
tagCoastal_Citizen2_B7=Yes, I found out where the restless dead go.  But there are so many, who would dare go in there?
tagCoastal_Citizen2_C2=So the skeletons will trouble us no more?  You have done a great service to Megara, warrior.  
tagCoastal_Citizen2_C7=In future times, children will play in those ruins and shepherds will tend their sheep there.
tagCoastal_Citizen3_A1=Old Eleusis?  That reminds me of an old myth they tell of the ruins.  They say it was ruled by three brothers, three princes.  But in their hubris they offended the god Apollo.  He cursed them never to enter Hades but to walk Old Eleusis as restless undead.
tagCoastal_Citizen3_A2=The three princes each mastered one form of warcraft, the old tales say.  Polypas bore sword and shield, Menon rained deadly arrows on their foes, and Aristeus worked magic of ice and lightning with a staff in his hand.
tagCoastal_Citizen3_A7=Could the old tales be true?  Could it be that the three brothers marshal the undead against us?
tagCoastal_Citizen3_B7=You have put an end to a great evil.  May the gods reward you.
tagCoastal_Seller_A2=I was on my way from Delphi with some goods to trade.  I had just set up camp amongst some nearby ruins when I heard the rattle of bone and smelled the scent of death.  I looked up and saw skeletons everywhere.  They didn't seem too friendly, so I ran.  As far as I'm concerned, whoever finds my goods can have them.
tagCoastal_Seller_A7=I lost my possessions but I kept my life.  I would call that a fair trade.
tagCoastal_Seller_B7=You found the goods I left?  No, I do not want them.  Painful memories.  They're yours.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_A1=The truth is, I've just arrived here myself.  I was on a warship bound for Athens when siren-song drove the crew mad.  Unguided, our ship smashed against some rocks.  I clung to a board and somehow washed ashore along with plenty of other timber and much of our cargo, which was arms and gold.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_A2=We washed ashore in an alcove on the Halcyon Coast, which lies towards Delphi.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_A3=The ship was bearing gold and weapons to Athens.  The chests that split now belong to Poseidon, but a few washed ashore.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_A4=I'd have returned to the beach, but strange and dangerous creatures roam the sands.  I barely escaped alive.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_A5=Old sailors tell tales of sirens singing to passing ships with voices so beautiful it drives the men mad.  When the ship hits the rocks, they feast on the sailors' bones.  But I never thought they were more than old sailors' yarns.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_A7=The Halcyon Coast lies between Megara and Delphi, but if you're looking for those chests, they're not in plain sight.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_B2=So you found the chests from the shipwreck?  I'm impressed.  Since you survived, I'd say you earned them.
tagCoastal_Sailor1_B7=Good luck, traveler.
tagDelphi_Villager2_A2=A blacksmith of remarkable skill lives in the hills by Helicos Pass.  Some say the god Hephaistos himself taught Termerus his craft.  He's friendly, but he keeps to himself.  If you can find him, he will sell to you at a fair price... if he likes you.
tagDelphi_Villager2_A3=Termerus is gifted, he can make marvelous things.  If he didn't live off by himself, he'd make a fortune.
tagDelphi_Chiron_A1=A gentle greetings, good traveler.  What, are you surprised to find a centaur not crazed with war and hatred?  My name is Chiron – I am pleased to meet you.  Sadly, I have a problem that I cannot solve.
tagDelphi_Chiron_A2=You see, I have long dwelt in these woods at peace with all the creatures... but recently they have gone mad, worst of all Ino, the maenad priestess.  When I stopped by the stream to drink, she surprised me,  stole my magic bow, then ran into a cave.  Warrior, I am a centaur – we are not fit for caves.  In that dark, cramped space we cannot fight well.{^n}{^n}If you would do me the kindness of retrieving my bow, I would gladly share with you my great store of wisdom and learning.
tagDelphi_Chiron_A7=Ino has not come out of the cave in three days.  No doubt she fears my anger.  The only way to get my bow back is to go in there.  That cave is no place for a centaur!
tagDelphi_Chiron_B1=My bow!  Splendid!  Warrior, you have my gratitude, and as I am noble, I am good to my word.  Let me bestow my thanks…
tagDelphi_Chiron_B2=It is true, all manner of beasts have gone utterly mad.  Even my centaur brothers who were never… civilized, are more savage than ever.  Something is calling them, somehow, and they answer.  But who or what calls them, I cannot tell.
tagDelphi_Chiron_B3=Can you guess how old I am, young one?  Very old, to your eyes.  I don't think you'll believe it, but I tutored the young Herakles in the ways of war.
tagDelphi_Chiron_B4=Hm… you have much potential, young warrior.  Men have poor vision, they only judge by outward signs.  Not until your worth is spelled out in great acts of heroism will you earn their respect.
tagDelphi_Chiron_B7=Thank you again, young warrior.  May fortune smile on your way.
tagDelphi_Chiron_C7=Ah, I fear my magic bow has been lost.
tagDelphi_Widow_A2=When the first satyrs attacked Delphi, my husband was quick to take sword against the beasts.  He and a few others fought bravely but were soon out-numbered... Stranger, I've seen him in my dreams!  He told me he cannot cross the river Styx to Hades until his death is avenged.   And he said – he said his killer was part boar and part man.  He said the beast hides underground, somewhere around Parnassus.
tagDelphi_Widow_A7=My husband's shade walks the shores of the river Styx, he finds no rest.  Oh, stranger!  These are hard, hard times!
tagDelphi_Widow_B7=I dreamt of my husband again.  His shade rests peacefully in the land of the dead.
tagAthens_Captain_A2=Hold on there.  We've got a giant limos trapped here.  Stay back... the thing is, we don't know what to do with it.  After we saw what it did to Leagrus…
tagAthens_Captain_A7=Whatever you do, don't go in there.  That thing is dangerous!
tagAthens_Captain_B1=You – you – how did you do that?  When you went in, I expected that limos to – to – my apologies noble warrior, I mistook you for a common traveler.
tagAthens_Captain_B2=That thing injured three of our men and you just went in there and – and – how did you do it?
tagAthens_Captain_B7=Noble warrior, thank you!
tagAthens_Soldier1_A2=We sent a scouting party out to the Athenian swamps.  They haven't returned yet.  I don't know what could possibly have delayed them.
tagAthens_Soldier1_A7=It seems as if every day we see stranger and more terrible monsters.  Did you hear about the Cyclops?  What if it's an army of Cyclops next?
tagAthens_Soldier1_B2=You were in the swamp?  You saw them?  Oh, good!  I was afraid they might've run into trouble in there.
tagAthens_Soldier1_B7=After the scouts get back, we'll move on to the Athens gates.
tagAthens_Scout1_A2=Hail!  You there!  A human face is a sight for sore eyes.  I'm sure our captain thinks we didn't make it.  Well we're alright, just a little lost.
tagAthens_Scout1_A7=If you see our troop, tell them we're on our way.
tagAthens_Citizen1_A2=Look, they've broken into the city.  Over there.  How did those gorgons get in?  I've called for help – hopefully soldiers will be here soon.
tagAthens_Citizen1_A7=Over there, see them? 
tagAthens_Citizen1_B2=Remarkable!  We need more of your type these days.
tagAthens_Citizen1_B7=We're lucky they didn't get into the market square.
tagKnossos_Citizen1_A1=Welcome, stranger.  All is not well here in Knossos.  Last night something passed by here, we felt it though we could not see it.  Now everything has gone into chaos.  Horrible creatures appeared, the ground shook, and an evil fog moved in off the sea.  Many of us have fallen mysteriously ill, and our healer, Xanthippus, is up in the hills.  Nobody has seen him for two days.
tagKnossos_Citizen1_A2=Whatever it was that came to Knossos, disaster followed it like a loyal hound.  
tagKnossos_Citizen1_A3=Derdas said he saw the thing.  He could barely describe it.  He said it was larger than a man and reeked of an ancient evil.
tagKnossos_Citizen1_A7=If only Xanthippus were here.  Perhaps he could heal our sick villagers.
tagKnossos_Citizen1_B2=Xanthippus is coming?  This is good news.  I was afraid with all this chaos... well I hope he comes soon.
tagKnossos_Citizen1_B7=My only hope is that Xanthippus can heal us from this strange new sickness.
tagKnossos_Citizen1_C2=So… the great evil that came to Crete was called a Telkine?  Is this true, that you slew it?  Then things should get better in Knossos.  They will, won't they?
tagKnossos_Citizen1_C7=If you slew that thing, you are truly a hero.
tagKnossos_Healer_A2=Yes, I am Xanthippus.  You speak of a strange sickness... the coming of this fog...  Well, I have a problem of my own.  I was gathering medicinal mushrooms in that cave when a monstrous spider came up behind me.  I ran out to safety, but unfortunately I left my staff in the cave.  Without it I will be of no help to the villagers.
tagKnossos_Healer_A7=I'm afraid I won't be any good to our sick without my staff.  It was a gift blessed by Hermes.
tagKnossos_Healer_B2=Hello there!  My name is Xanthippus.  It's not safe here anymore.  The undead and other things roam this ridge.  I was gathering mushrooms in that cave when a monstrous spider came up behind me.  I ran out to safety, but unfortunately I left my staff in the cave. 
tagKnossos_Healer_B7=I am a healer, you see, and I can't ply my trade without my staff.
tagKnossos_Healer_C1=Aha!  Thank you, stranger.  My healing staff…  Please, let me thank you for your troubles.  I… suppose I should head back.
tagKnossos_Healer_C7=Yes – I'll be on my way to town as soon as I catch my breath.
tagKnossos_Citizen2_A2=Once, long ago, the cruel tyrant Leucus seized the throne in Knossos.  His bloody reign came to an end when a servant poisoned him.  Some tell tales of his skeleton rising from its tomb nestled in Tritons Ridge.
tagKnossos_Citizen2_A7=Well I did not believe the tales, but I swear I saw the dead tyrant beyond this village last night.
tagKnossos_Citizen2_B2=…the undead tyrant did indeed walk the earth?  It is good that you slayed it.
tagKnossos_Citizen2_B7=Knossos is full of old myths.  Maybe there's truth to all of them!
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A1=It's not safe here – the city is overrun.  We cannot hold out.  I must stay here and stand guard, but, ah! …if only I had my sword!
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A2=That sword was my father’s, and his before him.  I cannot forgive myself for losing it.  What I wouldn’t give to have it back!
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A3=We fought bravely, but they outnumbered us ten to one; the only thing to do was fall back.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A4=The monsters would have come pouring down the main street, so we blocked the gate.  Now they are coming through the slums.  That is where I lost my sword to a fearsome jackalman.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A5=We made a foray into the slums and we were ambushed.  I escaped, but – a monster wrenched my sword from my hand.  Curse the beasts.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A6=If I could only go back and retrieve my sword!  No…  I must stand guard here.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_A7=That sword is in the slums somewhere.  No doubt some monster got hold of it.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_B1=My sword!  You found it!  Well…  I must thank you, warrior.  No – no, I feel it is my duty to repay your kindness.  Don’t refuse.  Take this.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_B2=I should warn you, it’s not safe.  The monsters will overrun all Rhakotis soon.  You should leave while you can.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_B3=We fought bravely, but they outnumbered us ten to one; the only thing to do was retreat.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_B4=The monsters would have come pouring down the main street, so we blocked the gate.  Now they are coming through the slums.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_B5=Ah, my trusty sword.  Let the beasts think twice about coming here.
tagRhakotis_Warrior_B7=My respects, warrior.
tagAbedju_Camper1_A1=There's something out there – something big that prowls at night.  They talk of camels missing in the morning and caravans being attacked.  Nobody's sure what it is, but they say it lives in a cave somewhere in Wadjet Canyon.
tagAbedju_Camper1_A2=Some say the monster is a giant scorpion.  Others say it is a man with armored skin.
tagAbedju_Camper1_A3=Whatever it is, the thing prowls at night attacking caravans and travelers.
tagAbedju_Camper1_A4=It is rumored that any warrior who can defeat it will be granted a magical blessing.
tagAbedju_Camper1_A7=It’s not just a story.  The other night, under the full moon, I swear I saw it.
tagAbedju_Camper1_B2=You found the scorpion-man and killed it?  Thoth inscribe it, that's a heroic tale!
tagAbedju_Camper1_B7=Now the stories will be of the strange warrior who slayed the Ancient Scorpos.
tagAbedju_Camper2_A2=For all I know, the stories about this giant beast may be true...  Or they may not.  But if they are, I’ll tell you, the Telkine that passed through here probably riled it up.
tagAbedju_Camper2_A7=Telkine...  know what that is?
tagAbedju_Camper2_B7=Wherever a Telkine goes, ancient horrors come to life.  Seems that wherever you go, they’re put to rest.
tagAbedju_Secreto_A1=That was a bit close.  Thanks for getting me out of that scrape.
tagAbedju_Secreto_A2=So you heard about the Telkine attacking us?  I don’t know what it’s after, but it doesn’t seem like we have the power to stop it.
tagAbedju_Secreto_A3=For the most part, I can hold my own, but I’ll admit I was in a tough spot when you arrived.
tagAbedju_Secreto_A7=I’m fine now.  Really.  Thanks for asking.
tagAbedju_Secreto_B7=Help!
tagAbedju_Farmer1_A1=It's been hard on us.  These monsters have made things hard.  We don't have walls, we don't have city guards.  And now – crocodiles that walk like men attack us nightly. 
tagAbedju_Farmer1_A2=These crocodile men raid our village.  They steal our children and our livestock and then, they're gone.
tagAbedju_Farmer1_A3=It is too much for us.  How can we tend our farms?  How can we work and live?
tagAbedju_Farmer1_A4=The reptilians – that’s what we call them – they are too strong, they are ruthless… we are at their mercy.
tagAbedju_Farmer1_A7=Soon it will be the monsters who farm here.  We cannot hold out against them.
tagAbedju_Farmer1_B1=Great Osiris, did you really kill them?  Praise to you, hero!  
tagAbedju_Farmer1_B7=I had lost hope…  I did not know heroes still walked the earth!
tagAbedju_Farmer2_A2=Have you heard?   A fierce breed of monsters has begun attacking our farms. It's true, I was unloading baskets of papyrus from my boat when I saw them.  They crept out from the marsh along the river – then attacked our village!
tagAbedju_Farmer2_A7=I won't even venture down to the water's edge after dusk. 
tagAbedju_Farmer2_B7=You know what they’re saying?  That somebody went and defeated all the reptilians.  Can you believe it?
tagAbedju_Farmer3_A1=You are the one who saved us from the reptilians.  To us, you are the greatest hero.  We do not have much, but please accept this thanks.

tagAbedju_Farmer3_A2=When no one else cared for simple farmers, you came and saved us.
tagAbedju_Farmer3_A7=Isis give you long life and happiness.
tagMemphis_OldBeggar_A2=Good warrior, we are the poor whom all disdain.  Others have walls and guards to shield them from the monsters, but our mud huts are overrun,  we have nothing.

tagMemphis_OldBeggar_A7=We had little before, and we've lost even that... no home, no place to sleep.
tagMemphis_OldBeggar_B1=Brave warrior, you have returned homes to the homeless, you have helped the lowest of the low whom the priests will not even acknowledge.  Please, have this.  Take it as our thanks.
tagMemphis_OldBeggar_B7=May Horus, god of the moon, shine upon your darkest hour.
tagMemphis_HighPriest_A1=I am Zazamankh, the High Priest of Memphis.  Second in power to Pharaoh himself!  The truth is… times are difficult.  You see, what with the monsters and Pharaoh in hiding, many are beginning to doubt the priests’ power.
tagMemphis_HighPriest_B1=If our authority is not respected, there is no order.  If there’s no order, people will panic, there will be chaos, and the monsters will take the city.  Everything ruined!  We have magic but not enough to stop the monsters.  Without authority, Memphis is lost – Egypt is lost!
tagMemphis_HighPriest_C2=Some... troublemakers have started demanding that we show the power they believe we have.  If you care to help, there is a staff of legendary power.  I would pay dearly for it.  With it, we could preserve order in Memphis.  We could lead.  We’d have a chance.  See?
tagMemphis_HighPriest_C7=The problem is – the staff is somewhere in the great pyramid of Giza.  That is, the tomb of Khufu.  It will not be easy to obtain, I assure you!
tagMemphis_HighPriest_D1=Shall I believe my eyes?  Is that the Staff of Khufu?  Osiris strike your enemies!  I must reward you handsomely for this.  Here.
tagMemphis_HighPriest_D2=With this staff, authority.  With authority, leadership.  With leadership, Memphis yet has hope against the monster threat.
tagMemphis_HighPriest_D7=As High Priest, second only to Pharaoh I thank you.
tagMemphis_Sister_A1=Pardon me – have you seen a man by the name of Unas?  He is my brother; he has vanished, and I fear the worst.
tagMemphis_Sister_B1=I am afraid Unas has gone on a foolish, dangerous errand.  According to family legend, somewhere in Giza a mystical guardian sleeps in a tomb.  I fear he has got it into his head to try and find this creature.
tagMemphis_Sister_B2=The story is long.  I had three brothers, they were all the family I had.  All held important stations in the Pharaoh’s army.  But one night, when the monsters first attacked, they were ambushed.  Unas got away… the others did not.
tagMemphis_Sister_B3=You see, an ancestor of ours supposedly bested this guardian, and in exchange for its life, the guardian promised eternal allegiance to his children and his children’s children.
tagMemphis_Sister_B4=Unas was wracked with guilt – because he survived the ambush.  He felt that it was his fault.  I think… I think he felt he could redeem himself by finding a way to avenge his brothers.  I fear he wished to use the guardian against the monsters that took our brothers' lives.
tagMemphis_Sister_B5=My brother is a skilled warrior – but this is a fool’s mission.  It gets more and more dangerous beyond the city walls every day, and he chooses to chase this legend.
tagMemphis_Sister_B7=If my brother has gone to seek the guardian, then you will find him and the tomb on the Giza Plateau.
tagMemphis_Sister_C1=Everything I feared… but thank the gods, Unas is alive.  Bless you, stranger, for your help.  That guardian was not our only family heirloom.  Have this.  It may come of use.
tagMemphis_Sister_C2=I know Unas must travel through dangers to return here, but I have faith he will.
tagMemphis_Sister_C3=I doubted that the guardian existed.
tagMemphis_Sister_C4=Perhaps … the same evil force that drives the monsters turned the guardian against us.
tagMemphis_Sister_C7=Oh, I won’t forget what you have done for me and my brother.
tagGiza_Brother_A1=I – stay back!  Don’t go in there!  It's gone mad.  It won’t obey me.
tagGiza_Brother_A2=You see, it was true, what my ancestors said.  There was a guardian, here.  Only – it won't obey me.  What did I do wrong?
tagGiza_Brother_A3=I wouldn’t go in there – It had sworn allegiance to my family, but now it has turned on us.
tagGiza_Brother_A4=Don’t go in there, I’m telling you!
tagGiza_Brother_A7=Oh!  What have I done?
tagGiza_Brother_B1=It – it’s dead, isn’t it?  I had hoped to use it against the monsters.  It should have followed my command, it was as if it was... possessed.  My sister, Tathari, must be worried sick about me.  I should return to her.
tagGiza_Brother_B2=I... I failed.  I thought, with the guardian, I could lead Egypt to victory.
tagGiza_Brother_B3=I should have told Tathari... I should have stayed and protected her.  I just thought – I thought – if it had only worked!
tagGiza_Brother_B4=You are a great warrior.  As great as my ancestor who first tamed the guardian.  If there were more like you, it would be the monsters who were hiding in fear!
tagGiza_Brother_B5=I have lost so much to the monsters.  I began to think I was cursed with an ill fate.  I should return to my sister; she’s the one thing I haven’t lost.
tagGiza_Brother_B6=It’s as if… some spell, some force drove the guardian mad, made it forget itself.  Yes, that must be what happened.
tagGiza_Brother_B7=Yes, I will return to my Tathari.  I… just need a moment.  It all happened so fast.
tagGiza_Nomad_A1=Monsters have broken in here – they must be stopped!  If they defile Pharaoh’s sarcophagus – terrible things will happen.
tagGiza_Nomad_A2=They are witless beasts, they don’t know.  A curse was cast on the Pharaoh’s mummy.  Anyone who defiles it, will spread a plague through the land.  Men and monsters will be afflicted alike.  
tagGiza_Nomad_A7=Somebody has to stop them!  If I were any kind of warrior…
tagOasis_Scamp_A2=Once I went into the desert – I wandered far, far into the desert.  Suddenly there were stairs in the sand!  I went down and there were chests and chests of treasure.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  I reached for the treasure, and suddenly beasts charged at me from the shadows.  I got out of there and fast!
tagOasis_Scamp_A7=I’d take my hide over some gold and jewels any day.  
tagOasis_Scamp_B2=You found the treasure in that tomb?  That treasure was mine!
tagOasis_Scamp_B7=I should've had that treasure.  I found it!  It should be mine!
tagOasis_Villager2_A2=It's true the caravans have stopped coming.  A dune raider chieftain named Iznu leads his tribe against all who travel the desert roads.
tagOasis_Villager2_A3=We used to have caravans deliver many goods.  Now that they’ve stopped, we’re short on everything – everything but water.
tagOasis_Villager2_A4=After the last caravan was attacked, I don’t expect to see anymore.
tagOasis_Villager2_A5=Things are bad these days.  No doubt about that.
tagOasis_Villager2_A7=The dune raiders used to keep to themselves.  Now they attack our caravans.
tagOasis_Villager2_B1=Iznu, the dune raider chieftain, defeated?  If it’s true that’s the first good news I’ve heard in days.  We’ll send an envoy to Memphis.  We’ll have trade again by the next moon.
tagOasis_Villager2_B7=I’ve had my doubts, but I’m beginning to think we’ll weather the monster scourge.
tagOasis_Traveler_A1=My plans don’t involve going back out into that desert.  Not after my caravan was attacked.  I lost everything.
tagOasis_Traveler_B1=I was bound this way with a full caravan when dune raiders attacked.  I managed to get away, but they got everything else – gold, weapons and supplies!
tagOasis_Traveler_B2=It’s safe enough here.  Plenty of water.  No monsters.  Why leave?
tagOasis_Traveler_B3=No, I don’t want my goods back.  I want to forget about the whole affair.
tagOasis_Traveler_B4=I was ambushed along the road.  Of course they probably dragged the caravan to some cave or camp.
tagOasis_Traveler_B5=I’m staying here.  No more traveling life for me as long as the monsters are out there.
tagOasis_Traveler_B7=Forget the caravan, what I want is revenge on those monsters.
tagOasis_Traveler_C1=You killed the cursed dune raiders, did you?  I would've paid you handsomely – only now I've got nothing.
tagOasis_Traveler_C2=I hope you helped yourself to what was left of the caravan.
tagOasis_Traveler_C7=Well, it appears my caravan will be the last to be troubled by Iznu's raiders.  That’s good news for Fayum.
tagThebes_Priest_A1=That which they call a 'Telkine' passed through here.  When it came, we all fled for we were cowards.  But our head priest, Neb-kemi, stood before the dread sorcerer.  With his staff high and his arm out-stretched, he fought it... only the terrible Telkine turned Neb-kemi's spells back upon him!  Our brave head priest was changed... utterly transformed.  He... is one of them now.
tagThebes_Priest_A2=I don't know where Neb-kemi went after the attack.  He followed the Telkine toward the Valley of the Kings.
tagThebes_Priest_A3=Neb-kemi's courage stemmed from his staff, which bears great magical powers.  Woe to any who find him now.
tagThebes_Priest_A4=First my heart filled with joy to see our high priest stand up to the Telkine.  But when his own magic turned him into a monster... it was more horrible than anything I’ve ever seen.
tagThebes_Priest_A7=The next time I see a Telkine, I shall flee with twice the speed.
tagThebes_Priest_B2=You found Neb-kemi?  Well... it is good... that he rests now.
tagThebes_Priest_B7=Truly, these are troubling times…
tagBabylon_Farmer1_A2=My livestock!  My farm!  Somebody, get the monsters out – before I lose everything!
tagBabylon_Farmer1_A7=The monsters are destroying everything.
tagBabylon_Farmer1_B1=You killed them.  Stranger, you saved my farm.  Oh, thank you!
tagBabylon_Farmer1_B2=Most of it is ruined, yes, but not all.  I can rebuild, if those monsters stay away.  Thank you.
tagBabylon_Farmer1_B7=Warrior, you saved my home.
tagSilkRoad_Caravan_A1=Well – I thought I was done for.  Thank you, friend.  Let's see, how can I repay you…
tagSilkRoad_Caravan_A2=I thought I could make it to the village up ahead.  I knew there were monsters, but I didn't know it would be this bad.
tagSilkRoad_Caravan_A3=If you hadn't come along, just when you did... I don't know what I would've done.
tagSilkRoad_Caravan_A4=When I reach the village, I just might hire some escorts for the rest of the journey.
tagSilkRoad_Caravan_A7=Fortune, health and wealth in your travels.
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_A2=In past times, we would rarely see a neanderthal.  Suddenly the tribes near us have grown bold... bold and powerful.  For two days now they have attacked us incessantly.  If only my son were here!  I have not seen him, and these are dangerous times.
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_A7=My son left some days ago.  I haven't seen him.  Now, with the neanderthal attacks... I fear the worst.
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_B1=I do not believe my ears.  The sacred weapons, missing from the temple?  If they have fallen into the hands of the neanderthals... 
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_B2=If the neanderthal tribes somehow stole the sacred weapons, this would explain their sudden strength, their new boldness... so much worse that my son is not here, in safety!
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_B7=The weapons stolen… my son missing… have we angered the mountains?  Have they turned against us?
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_C7=Thanks to you, stranger, we are safe from our enemies.  I only hope my son is safe too, and that he comes home…
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_D2=My son?  Alive?  Oh, happiness!  When he returns to me, I will forgive him.  Let there be no more anger and folly.
tagSilkRoad_Villager3_D7=We are safe now, thanks to you, warrior.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_A2=The spirits of our ancestors have turned on us!  They're attacking anyone who goes near the temple!  To make things worse, three sacred weapons are hidden in the ancestral cave.  Without them, we cannot defend ourselves against these new neanderthal attacks.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_A7=You see, stranger, our ancestors are revered.  We build the temple by the places where their spirits dwell.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_B1=What?  The pedestals were empty, are you sure?  The sacred weapons have been stolen!  What can this mean?
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_B2=The sacred weapons were kept in the cave of our ancestors for generations.  They were to help us in times of dire need.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_B3=I begin to fear… it is not chance:  the spirits, the neanderthal, the sacred weapons missing – all at one time.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_B7=The sacred weapons stolen from our temple!  What sorrow lies in store for us?
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_C2=Traveler, you came to us and saved us from much woe.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_C3=You have unraveled a mystery that blinded us.  I can see now that our ancestors' weapons were more dangerous than the neanderthal… perhaps we are better off without them.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_C4=I… think that the weapons of our ancestors… are better off with those who can wield them.  They have become dangerous to us.
tagSilkRoad_Villager4_C7=You are truly a friend of peace.  May all the spirits of all the earth bless you where you go.
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_A1=It's all my fault!  Our sacred weapons … I was such a fool!  Now the brute neanderthals have them.  There's no hope.
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_B1=I thought I would be a hero.  That's what I thought!  Take the weapons of our ancestors and decimate our enemies.  Then the mountains would be safe and peaceful.  But I lost them – I angered the spirits of our ancestors and the spirit of the mountain.
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_B2=I should have seen the ambush... I should have faced those neanderthals and fought them to the death.  But I didn't fight them.  I ran. I've never seen them so strong, they were maddened beasts.  They have the weapons now...
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_B3=Could I go back?  Could I return to my father after what I've done?  No, I am lost.  Please, don't tell anyone, don't tell my father.
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_B4=There's no hope of stopping them.  The neanderthals have the weapons now.  It would be death to go into their tribal caves.
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_B7=Please leave me be.  Tell no one where I am.  Better they think me dead.
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_C2=You, you stopped them.  I thought that with the weapons of our ancestors the neanderthals would be all-powerful.  I thought we were lost.  Oh!  This was all my fault.  
tagSilkRoad_LostSon_C7=Thank you, stranger.  I feel terrible for what I've done… but… you can tell my father I'll come home.
tagGreatWall_Warrior_A1=Why did you save me?  I have no wish to live.  I hoped only to die nobly.
tagGreatWall_Warrior_B1=Forgive me.  These  are dark times for our land.  When you have lost as much as I have, it is easy to lose hope.  But you, warrior, you fought those monsters as if hope still exists.
tagGreatWall_Warrior_C1=I fear… I may have been in error.  Every villager I did not protect…  I see it now.  I was wrong.  The only noble actions are selfless ones – protecting the weak and innocent from chaos and malice.  Yes, I see this now.
tagGreatWall_Warrior_C7=Warrior, your example has taught me wisdom.  I will protect our people to my last breath.
tagGreatWall_Warrior_D7=Let me be !
tagGreatWall_Mother_A1=Help!!  My daughter – she is trapped in the village.  Help me!!
tagGreatWall_Mother_A2=My daughter – she's trapped –  a raptor.  What can I do?
tagGreatWall_Mother_A7=Help!  Help!  My daughter, help!
tagGreatWall_Mother_B1=My daughter, alive?  Oh, stranger, thank you!  Thank you!
tagGreatWall_Mother_B7=Bless you!  You saved my daughter.
tagGreatWall_Collector_A1=These are dangerous times, aren't they, warrior?  Most of us dare not travel… even when we have great cause.  But one like you – you travel freely.
tagGreatWall_Collector_A2=There is a thing of great value.  It rests in a cave deep in the Jingyang Forest.  Although it is quite valuable, I would offer far more than its worth.  You see, that is how much I desire it.
tagGreatWall_Collector_A7=This trinket, it's deep in the cave.  Surely monsters have swarmed there.  But… I think I have gold enough to make it worth the trouble.
tagGreatWall_Collector_B1=Ah!  Excellent.  I am good to my word, here is your payment.  I hope you find it… satisfactory.
tagGreatWall_Collector_B2=Because there are monsters, should living stop?  Should all business end?  Some say so, but I say it is folly.
tagGreatWall_Collector_B3=Thank you, warrior.  Your help has been… most appreciated.
tagGreatWall_Collector_B4=Fortune has smiled on me.  I have some wealth.  I like to collect… rare things of value.
tagGreatWall_Collector_B7=Good day, traveler.  Fortune and prosperity come to you.
tagGreatWall_Villager1_A1=If you are taking the road to Chang'an, do not stray into the forest.  I have heard a terrible beast wanders there. 
tagGreatWall_Villager1_A2=Believe me, if you value your life, stay on  the path in the Jingyang Woods.
tagGreatWall_Villager1_A3=They say this beast is a monstrous man-spider, ancient and deadly.  It preys on weary travelers who stray from the roads.
tagGreatWall_Villager1_A4=There is another old myth that this forest beast was once no more than a simple spider – until it swallowed some item of great magic, which transformed it and gave it strength.
tagGreatWall_Villager1_A7=The Jingyang Woods are dark and dangerous.  Best to pass through them quickly!
tagChangan_Captain_A1=We are working hard to take back Chang'an, but we have more problems than just the monsters.  Somehow, the Great Emperor's clay soldiers have come to life.  The mausoleum where they were buried is overrun.
tagChangan_Captain_A2=There was a legend that the clay soldiers would come to life in our time of need – to defend us.  Now they attack us instead.  Something terrible has happened here.
tagChangan_Captain_A3=There was no warning – suddenly the terra cotta soldiers came pouring through the mausoleum door, swords drawn.
tagChangan_Captain_A4=It's a terrible development.  The monsters were giving us enough trouble!
tagChangan_Captain_A7=It is safe here.  Watch yourself past the guards and stay clear of the mausoleum.
tagChangan_Captain_B2=The mausoleum… you went in there, you stopped this spirit who brought the clay men to life?  By our ancestors, I did not think one hundred men could make it through there.
tagChangan_Captain_B7=Great warrior, you have done us a true service.
tagChangan_EmperorVoice_A1=Warrior, an ancient evil corrupted my terra cotta warriors.  You put this spirit to rest.  Those who adhere to duty and righteousness shall be rewarded.
tagChangan_Guard1_A1=The terra cotta soldiers aren't worse than the monsters.  No, the problem is our guards fear them.  They think somehow it's the spirit of the great emperor.  Nonsense.
tagChangan_Guard1_A2=Yes, the men are afraid.  They think anyone who kills one of these clay men will be cursed.  But we can't secure  the city until they're destroyed.
tagChangan_Guard1_A3=I guess I shouldn't blame them.  These times would make even a wise man superstitious.
tagChangan_Guard1_A7=I've offered a reward to anyone who'll fight them – but nobody's stepping forward.  
tagChangan_Guard1_B1=You've killed all the clay warriors in the city.  Our men were foolish to fear some curse.  Of course, an outsider wouldn't have such superstitions.  You have earned your reward.
tagChangan_Guard1_B2=With the clay soldiers gone, we only have the monsters to worry about.
tagChangan_Guard1_B7=Our chances of regaining control in Chang'an were not good.  Now that you've helped us, we just might stand a chance.
tagChangan_Citizen3_A2=Perhaps you can help me...  For ages, my ancestors have been laid to rest in a cave hidden behind the falls along the Jinghe river.  I used to go there with offerings, but when I last went spirits turned against me – they struck one of their own family!
tagChangan_Citizen3_A7=If you would cleanse the cave, I shall find some way to thank you.
tagChangan_Citizen3_B1=Noble warrior, thank you.  
tagChangan_Citizen3_B7=May fortune bring you long life, riches, and happiness!
tagJadePalace_Villager1_A2=A Taoist mage of great power lived by himself in the Jinghe Valley, not far from Qiyun.  He used to visit us for news and rice on every new moon.  But the moon has come and gone, and we haven't seen him.
tagJadePalace_Villager1_A7=The mage was peaceful.  He disliked violence and discord.  Though he lived simply, he was rumored to possess many treasures.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_A1=Why yes, stranger, you are now on Qiyun Mountain.  But how did you come here?  It is not safe; strange beasts are all around.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_A2=This path does lead to the mountain top.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_A3=My sisters and I live in the Jinghe Wetlands by ourselves.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_A4=No!  The monsters are no worry to me.  They would not touch me.   But you must be careful.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_A5=Qiyun is named for the white clouds that cover its peak.  There are many legends regarding that mysterious height.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_A7=The mountain top is not far.  Be careful.
tagJadePalace_Sister1_B7=You reached the top of Qiyun Mountain safely?  I hope you found what you were looking for.
tagJadePalace_Sister2_A2=Please!  Warrior!  You must help.  Something terrible has happened – my sister is in trouble.
tagJadePalace_Sister2_A7=Lao-Jun's charm has broken, the monsters are all around her.  Please help!
tagJadePalace_Sister2_B1=Oh, stranger!  You saved her!  Thank you.  Please, have this.
tagJadePalace_Sister2_B2=We are so grateful, stranger, that you saved our sister Ru Zhao.  She stumbled from the Way... she is subject now to the laws of life and death.  But now, perhaps, she has time to re-learn the secrets of immortality. 
tagJadePalace_Sister2_B3=When the spring rains come, when the cherry blossoms fall – we will remember your kindness.
tagJadePalace_Sister2_B7=Remember – the true way is like water.  It benefits all and asks no reward.
tagJadePalace_Sister3_A1=Oh!  I have never been so terrified.  I broke the enchantment.  I didn't mean to.  Suddenly I was surrounded by monsters.  Thank goodness you arrived!
tagJadePalace_Sister3_B1=I will explain, good warrior.  Long, long ago the great sage Lao-Jun concealed himself as a beggar and wandered through our land.  No one would spare him rice, none took him in – none except me and my sisters.  The great sage revealed his true self to us and gave us each a magic seed.  If you eat this, he said, no harm shall come to you, so long as you do no harm.
tagJadePalace_Sister3_C1=For hundreds of years we have lived peacefully alone, far from folly and wickedness.  But today by a stream, I saw a tiger man about to strike a harmless deer.  Before I could think I struck the monster with my staff… I killed it.  I knew at that very moment  that the enchantment had lifted – that I was protected no longer.   I dropped my staff and ran.
tagJadePalace_Sister3_C2=I was terrified!  For so long I had known peace and safety.  Suddenly every shadow was filled with danger.  Oh!  How can I live here with my sisters?  What have I done!
tagJadePalace_Sister3_C3=What will I do now?  I must go to the city… or learn the way of the warrior.
tagJadePalace_Sister3_C7=You saved me.  Thank you.
tagTomb_General_A1=Wusao Mountain is not far.  Cross this bridge.  Now leave me be.
tagTomb_General_B1=Once I was a powerful general, caught up in the illusion of life.  Then I was disgraced by my failure to stop the monsters; I resolved to come here to reflect upon my own nature… so I could truly learn theirs.
tagTomb_General_C1=Having no need for weapons or armor, I threw all I had deep into a cave near here.
tagTomb_General_C2=Mystery and knowledge are born of the same source: darkness.  Darkness is born of darkness, the mother of all things.
tagTomb_General_C3=Freed from desire, one can learn the hidden mystery.
tagTomb_General_C4=Wusao lies beyond this river.  Cross it and walk until you come to the barrens.
tagTomb_General_C5=Disgraced by my failure to defeat the monsters, I resolved to come here and reflect upon my own nature… so I could truly learn theirs.
tagTomb_General_C7=That which you seek lies across this bridge, as I told you.  A mountain cannot be hidden!  Now leave me to my meditation.
tagStarting_Peasant_A2=At harvest time the whole village sets to work in the fields.  The crops must be gathered and properly stored.  We make an offering to Demeter, goddess of bounty.
tagStarting_Peasant_A3=Here in Helos we live quietly.  We have avoided most of the wars.  We are farmers, unlike our Spartan brothers.
tagStarting_Peasant_A4= What drives these creatures to burn our fields and slay our cattle.  How do we stop them?
tagStarting_Peasant_A5=All the nights Timanthes played harp on the moonlit hill, we would dance and drink!  Now we hide in our homes and pray that we see another sunrise.
tagStarting_Peasant_A6=It was three nights ago, traveler, that the shepherd boy ran up crying about a satyr.  We didn't believe him, but he was right and now I never wish to see a satyr again.
tagStarting_Peasant_A7=Even the animals of the wild have turned against us; carrion birds and savage boars now hunt those who used to hunt them.
tagStarting_Storyteller_A2=O Muse, inspire me to speak of the mightiest hero ever known, son of Zeus, a god, and of a mortal woman – the man named Herakles.  Hated by the goddess Hera and beloved of Zeus, mighty-handed Herakles battled monsters great and fearsome.  The Nemean Lion he slew, and the Hydra, many-headed; the Erymanthian Boar and thunderous giants.  Twelve tasks of legend did he perform.  Herakles rose above the realm of mortals.  Once, it is told, he took the place of Atlas, who holds the world aloft.  Herakles, yes, Herakles bore the world itself upon his shoulders!  And now – now, where is a hero half as great as he?
tagStarting_Storyteller_A7=What became of Herakles, you ask?  The gods gave him immortality, and gathered him up to Olympus.
tagSparta_Soldier2_A2=I’ll tell you the truth – I just joined Leonidas’ men today.  My father gave me permission – and his old spear and shield – and I took off like Hermes himself.
tagSparta_Soldier2_A3=I’ll tell you, this is the time for heroes!
tagSparta_Soldier2_A4=I can’t wait to start the fighting.  Just let me get my spear-tip near one of those cursed satyrs…
tagSparta_Soldier2_A5=The old soldiers, they scoff.  They say you prove yourself fighting men.  But didn’t Herakles fight fabulous beasts?  And Theseus, too.
tagSparta_Soldier2_A6=I know it’s awful, those beasts should not attack old men and children.  They’re cowards.  They should attack us.  We Spartans could take on a sea of those dull-eyed harpies and centaurs!
tagSparta_Soldier2_A7=I can’t wait!
tagSparta_Soldier3_A2=I'll tell you, stranger, we've seen invasions.  Macedonians, the Persians – a human enemy may lower his weapons and yield.  But these monsters only yield to death.
tagSparta_Soldier3_A3=It's true they may be coming from some foreign land.  But I say they were here all along -- unseen.
tagSparta_Soldier3_A4=We know not where they are from, or what fuels their wrath.  In places where the corrupt beasts don’t hunt us, the dead crawl from the cold ground and take arms against us.  
tagSparta_Soldier3_A5=I've been in wars.  There you can look your enemy full in the eye – he looks back.  The eyes of the beast, they are cold, black beads.
tagSparta_Soldier3_A6=I woke with dawn.  I'll see satyrs fall at  my spear's tip before I sleep.
tagSparta_Soldier3_A7=If this plague of beasts persists, soon the only Greeks will be warriors.
tagSparta_Soldier4_A2=First we thought our enemy stemmed from Corinth.  We marched to meet them, but everywhere they attacked; from our flanks, from behind, at night, even in broad day!
tagSparta_Soldier4_A3=Now we're trying to push the beasts beyond our borders.  We patrol the roads and clear out farmers' fields - they just keep coming.
tagSparta_Soldier4_A4=General Leonidas is as great a man as I've ever followed.  I would place my life in his hands. Still… I don't see how to fight these beasts.
tagSparta_Soldier4_A5=The monsters show no fear and attack on sight.  We are better warriors, but many of us are unnerved by it.  They are truly beasts.
tagSparta_Soldier4_A6=I do not know what General Leonidas has planned.  But I will follow and I will fight.
tagSparta_Soldier4_A7=Be wary, traveler, these beasts do not fight like men.
tagSparta_PineVillager2_A2=News from all over Greece brings the same tale of destruction.  The creatures roam everywhere.  What are the small villages to do?  Spartans cannot protect us all!
tagSparta_PineVillager2_A3=You know, it was not far from here that Herakles fought the Nemean Boar.  If Herakles were here now, he would have his hands full!
tagSparta_PineVillager2_A4=I have lived here all my life as my father did before me.  I know where my grandmother's bones lie buried, and soon I fear mine will rest near hers.
tagSparta_PineVillager2_A5=We made offerings to Zeus for protection, and to Ares fearing we had offended the hateful god of war.  But still, the satyrs, centaurs and harpies beset us night and day.
tagSparta_PineVillager2_A7=May safety and fortune follow you.
tagSparta_Storyteller_A2=I sing now, Muse, of the goddess huntress we call Artemis; and I sing of a mortal man named Actaeon.  The goddess Artemis, sister to Apollo, and mistress of the moon:  there is no greater hunter than she, none more fleet, or sure of her mark with bow or spear.  Actaeon, too, was a master hunter, and many a deer fell to his bow, and many offered up to Artemis in thanks.  But Actaeon was given an ill fate.  One night, chasing a boar, he burst into a clearing by a stream.  And there – that very stream had keen-eyed Artemis selected for her moon-lit bath.  Naiads, dryads, all her nymphs around her, she had just disrobed and stepped into the stream when Actaeon appeared, wild from the chase.  She grew angry that a mortal man had seen her unclothed, and with one cold look, she turned him to a stag!  A stag he then became, and Actaeon's own dogs chased after him, snarling at their master, now their prey.
tagSparta_Storyteller_A7=So are we, stranger, the hounds snapping at our heels.  So are we. 
tagCoastal_Fisherman_A2=By the looks of you, traveler, your feet are sure and firm on land.  Well mine are just as sure aboard a sea bound vessel.
tagCoastal_Fisherman_A3=Fisherman:  that is my trade, that is my life.  It's dangerous these days.  Sirens stupefying sailors – and now, according to that fellow, kraken beasts big enough to eat a ship.  Think of it!
tagCoastal_Fisherman_A4=We are out on the water long before rosy-fingered dawn.  A good day, we're back in time to sell our catch.
tagCoastal_Fisherman_A5=Oh, there's bigger boats that come here – soldiers and traders from the corners of the earth.  But before them, my grandfather's father sailed fishing boats in Megara.
tagCoastal_Fisherman_A6=At first, when the monsters showed up I didn't worry.  Take to the sea, I thought.  But there are strange beasts in the water, too.  Nowhere is safe.
tagCoastal_Fisherman_A7=Well, safe travels a-land.
tagCoastal_Citizen4_A2=Why these monsters came, or what they want – nobody knows.
tagCoastal_Citizen4_A3=I have heard news from almost every city-state in Greece.  Beasts everywhere.  Houses burning.  Is there any hope left?
tagCoastal_Citizen4_A4=Megara will hold out.  We have warriors.  We can fish if we can't farm.  Beyond the walls I've heard rumors of bigger beasts – Cyclops.  Would the walls of Megara hold out against one of those?
tagCoastal_Citizen4_A5=What am I really afraid of?  I'll tell you.  I'm afraid I'll survive when these monsters have had their way with Greece... and raise my family hiding in caves, or cowering deep in the woods.
tagCoastal_Citizen4_A7=Megara has always been my home.  I will stay here come what may.
tagCoastal_Storyteller_A2=Muse, grant me voice, voice and memory to tell about the first of wars, the oldest battle, in the times before the gods had come to rule, when they were bowed beneath the heavy Titan hand.  The ill-formed Titans, great in strength and cruelty, oppressed the gods, their offspring – until at last behind the leadership of lightning-wielding Zeus, the gods took arms against the Titan kings.  It was the first war, and the greatest.  Oceans were moved and mountains overturned.  Gods and Titans struggled for dominion, might and cunning making victors first of one and then another, until at last, wearied in their age, the Titans lost the war.  The gods threw down their foes beneath the earth, into the pit of Tartarus – except for one, the strongest and cruelest of the Titans, and he they chained beneath a mountain for revenge.  Then Zeus was king of gods, and ruler over all the world.
tagCoastal_Storyteller_A7=The first gods, daughters and sons of the Titan Kronos, are Zeus, Hera, Demeter, Poseidon, and Hades.  They rule the sky, the earth, the sea, and the underworld where the dead come to dwell.
tagDelphi_GuardCaptain_A1=You're not the first to come here, thinking that the god Apollo would protect his own temple from the monsters.  Oh, *we* protect it.  Good warriors have fallen, and no meteor, no arrow has come down from the heavens to strike our enemies.
tagDelphi_GuardCaptain_A2=Last night was the worst.  So many of them came.  We sent the refugees up to the Temple courtyard and prayed to Athena we would not fall back that far.  But we held out... 
tagDelphi_GuardCaptain_A3=The temple still stands unmolested, and I will see to it that it stays that way.
tagDelphi_GuardCaptain_A7=We are besieged by this monster plague.  But still, we stand firm.
tagDelphi_Villager3_A2=Everywhere across Greece harvests go untended.  Country villages are burned and abandoned.  Peasants gather in cities for safety.  I say the arrow is already in Greece's breast.
tagDelphi_Villager3_A3=If the monsters were gone tomorrow, how many would still die from starvation… homeless... families torn apart?
tagDelphi_Villager3_A4=Thinking they had offended the gods, they gathered a great offering to Zeus: sixty sheep and goats and other livestock. The fires were lit.  They were ready to begin, and a pack of maenads descended on them leaving none alive.
tagDelphi_Villager3_A5=Do these monsters fear no gods?  It's as if they fear nothing.
tagDelphi_Villager3_A7=Yes, I think the arrow has already pierced Greece through the heart.
tagDelphi_Delphian2_A2=The tents you see on our roads, the travelers standing around, they are all refugees.  They are all people who came here, and could not leave because of the monster scourge.
tagDelphi_Delphian2_A3=Do you know about the Oracle?  It is said that when she delivers a prophecy she speaks not with her own voice, but with the voice of the god Apollo himself.
tagDelphi_Delphian2_A4=The Oracle belongs to the Temple of Apollo here in Delphi.  Apollo – god of the arts and prophecy, meteors, and medicine.  God of harmony and reason, brother of the archer-goddess Artemis.
tagDelphi_Delphian2_A5=It is safe here, for now.  But every day that passes is a darker day for Greece.
tagDelphi_Delphian2_A6=The Delphic Oracle is the most famous.  Philosophers and generals seek council here, and the Oracle never errs.
tagDelphi_Delphian2_A7=If you are going to the Oracle, you will find her inside the great temple along this road.  Good luck.
tagDelphi_Storyteller_A2=Speak through me, O Muse, and tell of the war with Troy.  The war began with gods, but ended among mortal men.  When the goddess Eris threw a golden apple to the gods, "to the fairest" written on its side, Athena, Hera, Aphrodite, the three great goddesses, could not agree to whom the thing belonged.  Athena wise and warlike, Hera regal queen, and Aphrodite whose domain is love.  They sought a mortal man, a royal prince of Troy, named Paris, to resolve their fight.  Hera offered kingdoms, Athena offered skill in war and bravery, but Aphrodite offered Paris the most beautiful woman in the world, and he chose her.  Alas!  This woman was the wife of great king Agamemnon, and when Paris claimed fair Helen, the house of Troy brought on the wrath of all the Greeks.  They sailed in war to claim the stolen bride, and many men fell in that bitter feud, fought for the folly of the vain, proud gods.
tagDelphi_Storyteller_A7=The greatest mortal warrior ever to live, was born and died to fight that war.  For he was named Achilles, Thetis' son, whose wedding Eris was not invited to.  He led the Greeks to victory, but died himself in glorious battle.
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A1=Well!  How much has happened since I saw you last?  I'm sure the tales you could spin are at least as long as mine.
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A2=If you had asked me when we were in Sparta if I would ever stand guard before the walls of our old enemy – I would've laughed at you.  But here we are!
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A3=General Leonidas does not deserve the blame he puts on himself.
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A4=There are times I am filled with the deepest doubt.  These are dark times.  I was raised from boyhood to fight, but I was never prepared for the chaos and hopelessness we now face, all of us.
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A5=When news of the monster army came, we marched at dawn the next day.  We were joined by the Tegeans and Corinthians, and word came that the Thebans were already there.  We arrived in time to stand and gaze out from these walls here, when the first wave of beasts came into view…
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A6=What a battle!   The enemy host crossed these fields at dusk.  The Greeks, united, formed a lethal wall of spear and shield.  From behind, our archers rained death upon the enemy.  But there were so many monsters, so many.  We barely won, and some say this was only because their mysterious general disappeared as the sun set.
tagAthens_Bodyguard_A7=Most of our enemy have fallen, and while small groups of these creatures still charge our lines, towns and villages elsewhere are burning.
tagAthens_Citizen2_A2=What I'd like to know is, why did they come here, to Athens?  Was it our wealth?
tagAthens_Citizen2_A3=I'll tell you what worries me.  We drove them back from Athens – but what about our farms?  All of  Athens must be fed!
tagAthens_Citizen2_A4=Not everything is bad.  Goods are selling well, only what do I do when my stocks run low?  By boat, you say.  Fine, but they're in short supply.  They cost a fortune!
tagAthens_Citizen2_A5=Tell me this.  What will the monsters do if they take Greece.  It will become a wilderness!  No philosophy, no poetry, no vineyards or olive orchards.  Utter tyranny!
tagAthens_Citizen2_A7=Well, I can thank Athena that I'm inside these walls, and not out there.
tagAthens_Philosopher_A2=The best of human nature shows when united by a common threat.  Have you noticed this?  With the monster scourge upon us, old rivals help protect each other.  Without it, we'd return to petty differences.
tagAthens_Philosopher_A3=What is it in fear that disarms a man?  They say that these monsters do not flinch or flee as humans do.  Do they know the taste of fear?  Are they braver than we are, or are they mere beasts beneath cowardice and bravery both?
tagAthens_Philosopher_A4=Yes, I am a philosopher.  My greatest love is to ponder the nature of humanity and of this mortal world.
tagAthens_Philosopher_A5=You are a warrior, seasoned in battle.  Tell me, do you think bravery is what chases out fear, or can fear and bravery share equal portions of a man's heart?
tagAthens_Philosopher_A7=I know much, but the cause of the monster scourge is beyond my understanding.
tagAthens_Storyteller_A2=O Muse, I sing now of a mountain nymph named Maia, and how with Zeus, she bore a son named Hermes.  Thus was born the swiftest god, fleet of foot with sandals winged, patron god of travelers and boundaries, of shepherds, and of thieves.  Hermes – who leads the dead to Hades, and who has often aided heroes in their tasks.  When Maia gave birth, lying in a cave in Mount Cyllene, she took the infant in her arms and quickly fell asleep.  The bright-eyed infant Hermes, seeing that she slept, crawled from her arms then ran to Thessaly.  He found the pasture where Apollo's sacred cattle grazed, forbidden to any but their owner.  The infant Hermes stole some cows and hid them well away.  He slaughtered one and took its gut and with an empty tortoise shell, constructed the first lyre.  The fleet-foot god then ran back home and wrapped himself back in his mother's arms, but Apollo appeared, angrily claiming Hermes had stolen his cattle.  It was then the infant took the lyre and began to play, and the lyre's sweet sound directly charmed Apollo, god of music,  and he relented in his anger.  He saw the lyre, and his desire for it was so great he offered to let young Hermes tend his cattle - in exchange for the instrument.  And so the first, but not the last, of Hermes' mischief came to no ill end.
tagAthens_Storyteller_A7=They say that Hermes invented the pan-pipes next, and traded them for the travelers' staff he always carries.
tagKnossos_Citizen3_A2=People are saying that some… thing of great power and evil came into Knossos last night.
tagKnossos_Citizen3_A3=I was sleeping, I don't know what happened.  When I awoke, it was to the rumbling of the earth.  A foul fog had rolled in… and with it a horde of beasts.  Great, horrible monsters!
tagKnossos_Citizen3_A4=I do not know what has happened to us… surely we have offended the gods!
tagKnossos_Citizen3_A7=I wouldn't stay here, traveler.  I'm afraid we are cursed!
tagKnossos_Storyteller_A2=Truly, the greatest builder ever to live was the man named Daedalus.  Inspiring Muse, grant to me the words to tell his tale.  For Minos, King of Crete, did Daedalus make the Labyrinth.  It was built to house the terrible minotaur.  When Minos imprisoned him high in a tower, Daedalus built wings of wax, two sets of wings, one for himself, another for his son.  Then he gave careful warning to his son.  Fly not too high, he told him, for the sun will melt the wax.  Fly not too low, for if the wings get wet they will not fly.  Then son and father put on the wings and with the dawn took flight, away from Crete and cruel King Minos.  But as the day got on young Icarus took joy in flight, and, forgetting his father's words, soared up into the sky.  He neared the sun, the waxen feathers softened – melted – and foolish Icarus fell from the sky.   Daedalus flew on to Sicily and there he grieved.  He named the place Icaria, where Icarus fell, and then in Sicily he built a temple to Apollo, and left his wings as an offering in the temple there.
tagKnossos_Storyteller_A7=There is a lesson to all in this story.  The master knows balance, he neither flies too low nor too high, and reaches the far shore.  The novice in his inexperience flies high, then falls, a short and beautiful life.
tagRhakotis_Citizen3_A2=Monsters in Greece, too...  So they are everywhere!  Ah, but things can’t be as bad as they are here.  It’s not possible.
tagRhakotis_Citizen3_A3=First the monsters were in the desert, then in the roads and villages.  ‘It’s terrible,’ we said. But now, look!  They run through our cities.  They defile our temples.
tagRhakotis_Citizen3_A4=I left my home, a fine home with servants and livestock, for safety in Rhakotis.  Now Rhakotis is overtaken, what will I do?
tagRhakotis_Citizen3_A5=Where is the Pharaoh’s army I ask you?  Scattered!  They are useless.
tagRhakotis_Citizen3_A6=Some say the monsters are the children of Set, enemy of the gods.
tagRhakotis_Citizen3_A7=Ah, stranger, whatever you came here for, all you’ll find are troubles. 
tagRhakotis_Storyteller_A2=In the realm of the gods, things are as they are for all of time.  When each day is done, Atum-Ra, beneficent god of the sun, descends from the sky.  There it is that he must set off in the boat of Ma’at, to travel the murky waters of night – for without the boat, in those dark waters he would be extinguished.  And there, too, lurks Apep, the giant serpent formed at the start of time, coiled just before dawn, in the tenth region of night.  As Ra passes by, Apep leaps out and, enormous jaws gaping wide, tries to devour the sun god.  But fortunately, Ra is strong, and on his boat rides a host of gods who struggle with the monster serpent, and fight it back, and ensure that when the new day comes, the sun will rise again.
tagRhakotis_Storyteller_A7=It is true, some say that Apep was thrown beneath the world and half his length is trapped beneath a mountain.  They say if ever he should be freed, all chaos will reign.
tagAbedju_Camper3_A2=You do not want to travel these ways unarmed.  From what I hear, monsters are getting into the cities now, too.  Soon, nowhere will be safe.
tagAbedju_Camper3_A3=Some of us here were soldiers in the Pharaoh’s army.  I was one.  But then things turned bad – now it’s everyone for himself.
tagAbedju_Camper3_A4=If you got this far, I’m guessing you’re pretty tough.  Are you looking for something… or just looking for trouble?
tagAbedju_Camper3_A5=I lost hope after we came back from fighting in Iunu.  I don’t know what became of my wife and child...  But our house was burned down and our cattle slaughtered… 
tagAbedju_Camper3_A6=Once I found myself face to face with something that looked like a crocodile, only bigger, and it stood upright.  I gave it a knock it won't soon forget, then I ran.
tagAbedju_Camper3_A7=I’ll move on when I’m ready.  Nowhere is home to me.  Not anymore…
tagAbedju_Farmer4_A2=You must understand – every year the river Nile rises.  If it didn’t rise our crops would not grow.  If it rises too much our homes and farms are swept away; not enough, and we starve.  This is our life.
tagAbedju_Farmer4_A3=Yes, the monsters are terrible but the Nile is too.   
tagAbedju_Farmer4_A4=These monsters are clearly sent by the gods.  Maybe by Set, who is the old enemy of Osiris.
tagAbedju_Farmer4_A5=Understand – we are farmers.  If the Nile wishes to destroy us, if the desert wishes to destroy us, if  the monsters, or sickness, or cruel soldiers wish to destroy us – what can we do?
tagAbedju_Farmer4_A6=Stranger, the gods are in everything.  Bast lives through the cat.  Horus is the moon, and Nut the sky above him.
tagAbedju_Farmer4_A7=Ah!  These are times of much sorrow.  Worse by far than famine or drought.
tagMemphis_Priest2_A1=Sometimes it is hard to remember the old life.  When I do, it is as a sweet dream.  That life, the life of a priest, was a good one.
tagMemphis_Priest2_A2=There were the ceremonies and rituals, the rich banquets and the humble gifts of farmers, artisans and merchants.  But mostly, the many sweet hours bent over parchment with my reed pen.
tagMemphis_Priest2_A3=Yes, I was a scribe priest.  As Thoth to the gods, so was I to the high priests and the Pharaoh, recording things of great importance.
tagMemphis_Priest2_A4=We have tried to follow the old ways, but with the monsters – everything is so hard!
tagMemphis_Priest2_A5=Oh, these days, the people of Egypt are losing their sense!  They do not respect us.  They say 'Where are the gods to slay these beasts?  Where is your magic to protect us?'
tagMemphis_Priest2_A6=These monsters have changed everything.  Our magic cannot stop them.  What I want to know is – did the gods abandon us, or did we anger them and make them our enemies?
tagMemphis_Priest2_A7=Those old times are a dream… sometimes I think they won’t ever return.
tagMemphis_Citizen_A1=Did you hear about this thing, they say it’s far worse than any monster.
tagMemphis_Citizen_A2=They’re saying it is a lord among monsters.  They say the beasts flock to it, and everywhere it goes, it is surrounded by them, like the Pharaoh with his guard.
tagMemphis_Citizen_A3=Whatever it was, people were saying it was in Rhakotis and then it headed this way.
tagMemphis_Citizen_A4=They say this lord of monsters can kill a man just by looking at him!
tagMemphis_Citizen_A5=I wonder if it is the evil god, Set, who the Greeks call Typhon.
tagMemphis_Citizen_A7=Worse than the monsters – just think of it!
tagMemphis_Soldier_A1=Here’s one – you there.  How about a job in the Pharaoh’s army? No, of course not.  Nobody wants this job, not these days.
tagMemphis_Soldier_A2=Have you heard the talk about this Greek hero?  Mighty as the heroes of legend.  Killed the evil magi who made the beasts, is what they’re saying.
tagMemphis_Soldier_A3=The truth is, things are bad here.  Plenty of soldiers have died, but more have deserted.
tagMemphis_Soldier_A4=What's left of the army can be found in the cities, guarding the gates and keeping order.  We're not on the offensive any more.
tagMemphis_Soldier_A5=I think the gossip is true – Set must be returning from exile, and these monsters are his servants.  That is why Pharaoh had to hide.
tagMemphis_Soldier_A6=I’ve been a soldier all my life.  I couldn’t leave it.  Sometimes I think with a true and mighty leader,  we might just – ah, but what’s the chance of that?
tagMemphis_Soldier_A7=Soon there won’t be any army, just lone soldiers at city gates.
tagMemphis_Shepherd_A2=Far in the desert, the wind will lash sand into columns in the air.  Sometimes a demon will take such a column for a body, and we call that a sandwraith.
tagMemphis_Shepherd_A3=Egypt is the Nile.  The farther from the Nile, the less Egypt – and the more desert.
tagMemphis_Shepherd_A4=The desert was always our enemy, and always we lived there.  Monsters are no different.
tagMemphis_Shepherd_A5=Those who tend the land, who practice magic in the temple, they live one in place all their lives.  Pha!  That’s no life, no life at all.
tagMemphis_Shepherd_A6=The sands are keepers of secrets, and the winds whisper only riddles.  Riddles and lies.
tagMemphis_Shepherd_A7=Headed into the desert, traveler?  Are you sure you’re ready? 
tagMemphis_Storyteller_A2=Now Set and Osiris were brothers, children of Nut and Geb, sky and earth.  By destiny Osiris was the first Pharaoh, and he ruled over the land with Isis, his queen.  He taught us to farm the land, to build and bake, to count and record.  But Set was jealous of his brother, and he devised a plan.  Set built a beautiful box of cedar, and told Osiris that whoever fit inside could have the box.  Osiris, trusting his brother, lay down inside – wicked Set quickly closed the box and nailed it, then threw it in the Nile.  But when Isis retrieved the box, Set grew angry.  He found it and tore it open and cut his brother into thirteen pieces, throwing them into the Nile.  Isis again went out.  She searched and searched, but found only twelve.  She then took wax, and with magic formed the thirteenth part.  In secret, hidden from Set’s eyes, she performed the rites and ceremonies, so that Osiris could properly enter the land of the dead, where ever since he has reigned.  And just like Osiris, the first Pharaoh, do all our Pharaohs go to death.
tagMemphis_Storyteller_A7=Yes, and it was Horus, son of Isis and Osiris, who reigned in Egypt thereafter.  And when he was old enough, he made war on his evil uncle, Set.  Set was banished to the desert, banished from Egypt by all the gods.
tagOasis_Villager3_A1=Good to meet you.  I’m glad to see a new face.
tagOasis_Villager3_A2=Before the monsters came, caravans were always coming and going.  Our market was filled with the noise and bustle of trading, haggling, and friendly banter.  Now all is quiet and dismal.
tagOasis_Villager3_A3=Yes, it is safe here in Fayum, but it’s lifeless.  It’s a prison.  It takes ten armed men to reach Memphis.
tagOasis_Villager3_A4=Did you hear the news?  The Temple of Osiris was attacked last night – its walls and pillars toppled!  To think that there are monsters as powerful as that!
tagOasis_Villager3_A5=You could say that as long as the city walls stand, we will get by.
tagOasis_Villager3_A6=The priests say they know all sorts of magic.  I’d like to see them use a spell to get rid of these monsters.
tagOasis_Villager3_A7=Ah… I can remember those days, when the winds blew in off the desert…  and in the market the smell of baked bread and roasted goat…
tagOasis_Storyteller_A2=Once there were two lands, the kingdom of the upper Nile and the kingdom of the lower.  It was at this time that Horus ruled upper Egypt, and the wicked Set ruled along the lower Nile.  When they made war and fought, Set gouged Horus in the eye, and Horus cut off half Set’s virility.  Horus emerged victorious, and he was called Horus the great.  Set was exiled to the desert.  The desert was dry and infertile because of Set’s wound, and still, the light of the moon, which is Horus’s left eye, is pale compared to the light of the sun, which is his right.
tagOasis_Storyteller_A7=Now the first Pharaoh of the two kingdoms was called Menes – he was the human, and he represented Horus.  That’s…  well, it’s complicated.   Horus was the first, and among mortals he was Menes.  And it was he who first wore the two crowns together, the symbol of the Pharaoh.
tagThebes_Citizen1_A1=Have you heard the news?  A terrible monster was here.  They’re calling it the master of beasts. Creatures of the sand follow it like loyal dogs.
tagThebes_Citizen1_A2=Oh I saw it with my own two eyes.  The monsters flocked around it, it’s true.
tagThebes_Citizen1_A3=It came right through Thebes and did not stop.  It went out that gate and on towards the Valley of the Kings.  Why would it travel there?
tagThebes_Citizen1_A4=Most of the monsters are dumb brutes.  But this one, the master, moved with a cold and terrifying intelligence.
tagThebes_Citizen1_A5=When I saw it, my hair stood on end.  My skin crawled.
tagThebes_Citizen1_A7=What did it want in the Valley of Kings, I wonder?
tagThebes_Citizen1_B7=Is it true, that some great hero of legend slew the master of beasts?  It is not possible, is it?
tagThebes_Citizen2_A1=Everyone asks where the monsters came from.  It is clear as day.  They were sent by the enemies of the gods!
tagThebes_Citizen2_A2=Set, who the Greeks call Typhon, was banished to the desert, after a terrible battle against Osiris.  
tagThebes_Citizen2_A3=You see, Set, cursed be his name, hates our gods, and thus he hates Egypt’s two kingdoms.
tagThebes_Citizen2_A4=No human mage could have done this.  It was the giant serpent Apep, who dwells coiled beyond the edge of the world.  As Atum-Ra descended from the sky, Apep bit his heel, then he spit out the blood, and, uttering a magic spell, turned each drop into a monster.
tagThebes_Citizen2_A5=No, there is nothing we can do – nothing.  It is Osiris who must save us, but he is sleeping, for Set cast a foul spell upon him!
tagThebes_Citizen2_A6=It may very well be true that Set seduced Sekhmet, goddess of war, to his side.  That is why the gods could not stop them.
tagThebes_Citizen2_A7=Truly, this is a war of the gods, just as they fought long ago.
tagThebes_Storyteller_A2=Oh the dead – in these times, so many dead!  When Egypt was untroubled, all were buried with the book of the dead.  In this book are written many spells and other things one must know to safely pass through Duat, the kingdom of death.  After using the spells to get past demons and monsters of various types, they reach the halls of the dead.  There Osiris, lord of the underworld, will weigh their heart upon the scales of justice.  On one side the heart, on the other side, the feather of truth.  If they were wicked in life, their heart will be heavy, and they will be thrown to the monster Ammut, devourer of souls.  But if the heart is light, they are free, given a second life there in Duat, the land of the dead.
tagThebes_Storyteller_A7=Many, many are not properly buried, in these times.  Few of those souls will ever reach happiness and peace.
tagBabylon_Storyteller2=In ancient times, the goddess Ninsun bore a son to king Lugalbanda, and he was called Gilgamesh.  Two parts god and one part mortal, he came of age and became king, the mightiest of men ever to live.  Now Anu, the sky god, created a man named Enkidu, wild and untamed, and sent him to Babylon.  There Enkidu and Gilgamesh fought; now no other man was stronger than Enkidu, but even he could not defeat Gilgamesh.  So he bowed to the king, and they became best of friends.  Now, the great are called to do great deeds, and before long, Gilgamesh longed to vanquish the terrible guardian of the cedar forest, called Humbaba.  So he and Enkidu set out, praying first to the sun god Shamash.  And it is good they did, for without his help, it might have gone badly.  But the two warriors, helped by the sun god, traveled far to the cedar forest and, heroes that they were, slayed the demon monster there.  It was Gilgamesh, rightful king, who cut off the monster's head.  From the cedar wood, they built a giant raft, and with it floated home again, victorious.
tagBabylon_Storyteller7=After Enkidu died, Gilgamesh sought long the secret of immortality.  But in the end, even he, mightiest of mortals, in truth part-god, was forced to realize death is a part of life.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A1=Hello.  We're just preparing for the ascent into Natu La Pass.  Thought we'd be in the east by now but travel has been rough. 
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A2=I hate to say it, but with all these monsters, we might just turn back.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A3=Trading goods – one end of the world to the other.  Spices, silk and jade that way; cedar, gold and lapis lazuli this way.  Good money, when it's not too dangerous!
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A4=Most people live their entire lives in the same village.  No new faces, no new anything.  The lands I've traveled to, the things I've seen and heard – it's all worth it.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A5=No bones about it:  this monster scourge is not good for us traders.  Oh yes, they're in most lands by now, east and west.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A6=The people here are simple and kind.  They believe powerful spirits are in the mountains, lakes, and streams.  Always ask permission, they'll tell you.  Don't anger the land you walk on.
tagSilkRoad_Traveler3_A7=Well, friend, I hope you find what you're looking for.
tagSilkRoad_OldMan_A1=Over the mountains you came.  Now, into the caves of ice you go.  It is the only way.  And after that – ah, but you'll see for yourself!
tagSilkRoad_OldMan_A2=Yes, you've come far, far, for the curved blade… and its master.
tagSilkRoad_OldMan_A3=Through the ice caves.  Otherwise, you won't catch up!  He moves quickly.  You must, too.
tagSilkRoad_OldMan_A4=How do I know?  Earth told me, when it heard your footsteps.
tagSilkRoad_OldMan_A5=How do I see?  Wind told me, when it felt your breath.
tagSilkRoad_OldMan_A7=Yes, the ice caves and then – then you will see for yourself!
tagSilkRoad_Storyteller_A2=The eighteen kingdoms are ruled together from the Silver Palace of Garuda Valley, far south of here.  They say that valley is none other than  Shambhala - the Land of Happiness.  Our shamans, who we call Dongba, tell us of these things.  I have never gone so far myself!
tagSilkRoad_Storyteller_A3=Our shamans use many things such as prayer flags and rice offerings to appease the spirit world.
tagSilkRoad_Storyteller_A4=If we do not live harmoniously with the spirit world, many ill things will befall us.  All of nature... that’s what is the spirit world.
tagSilkRoad_Storyteller_A7=Our shamans learn powerful magic from the spirits.  They lead us and protect us.
tagGreatWall_OldMan_A2=Now do you see?  Through the caves.  Follow the blade… beware the master.
tagGreatWall_OldMan_A3=The earth cried when that one passed… now it laughs when you walk here.
tagGreatWall_OldMan_A4=The wind runs ahead, with tidings of destiny!
tagGreatWall_OldMan_A7=Beware the master, you do not know him.
tagGreatWall_Villager2_A1=Ah!  A guest to our village.  Lately, we've only had the rude kind – I mean the monsters.
tagGreatWall_Villager2_A2=A peasant – he fears to walk the roads these days.  But you – by your looks, it's the monsters that tremble.  Am I right?
tagGreatWall_Villager2_A3=Yes the monsters were here before.  Now more come, so peace and harmony will stay far from our land.
tagGreatWall_Villager2_A4=My sons have gone east to Luoyang.  I long so much to see their faces, but I hope they stay there where it's safer.
tagGreatWall_Villager2_A5=Ha!  The army.  They'll defend the wall, but look!  Monsters are here, here on this side.  Well.  Will they defend all of us?  No, they can't, can they? 
tagGreatWall_Villager2_A7=A good day to you.
tagGreatWall_StoryTeller_A2=When Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, was invited up into the heavens, it was trouble.  The Monkey King was stubborn, strong and clever.  Sun Wukong knew all kinds of magic; he could jump eight hundred miles in a single leap, and he had a staff that changed size at will!  When the Jade Emperor, ruler of the immortals, invited the Monkey King, they thought he might behave!  Maybe he would have, but sadly for them, they did not invite Wukong to the royal banquet.  To spite their rudeness, he was later found eating all the Peaches of Immortality from the Empress' tree, and he did many other wicked things besides.  Then there was trouble.  After he defeated the army of the heavens single-handedly, and caused much other trouble, the Immortals finally caught Sun Wukong.  They trapped him under a mountain, a whole mountain, and there he's still stuck today!
tagGreatWall_StoryTeller_A7=That's the story they tell.  I didn't see it happen, and you didn't either.  Some say earthquakes happen when Sun Wukong struggles against his bonds.
tagChangan_Citizen1_A2=The Great Master, Confucius, taught us that ritual and virtue would perfect the world.  But what good are they when rough beasts burn our houses and storm our walls?
tagChangan_Citizen1_A3=It is said our highest aim is to create virtue and harmony throughout the world… but such thoughts seem like a baby bird, trapped in a raptor's jaws!
tagChangan_Citizen1_A4=All my life I have studied and tried hard to observe my duties… what if all of it is swept away, like the wind sweeps fog from the river's edge.
tagChangan_Citizen1_A5=You are a true warrior, I can see.  We all should have studied the ways of war – in the end, maybe that is the only wisdom.
tagChangan_Citizen1_A6=Rites and music' is what Confucius taught, meaning order and harmony.  One is our duty, the other, our reward.
tagChangan_Citizen1_A7=There is little hope in these times… yet we still must live by virtue.
tagChangan_Citizen2_A2=Ah, warrior, what will become of our world?  What will happen to us when the monsters rule it?
tagChangan_Citizen2_A3=I lost my sister, my mother, my father...  Would you call me lucky to live – in times such as these?
tagChangan_Citizen2_A4=Hope?  How can we have any hope?  More and more monsters come.  Who knows how to stop them?
tagChangan_Citizen2_A5=True, there is the army.  At first they marched in unison against the monsters.  But then in the chaos they were scattered.  Harmony and order are broken, hope is lost.
tagChangan_Citizen2_A6=Look around you.  This is the imperial city, where kings once trembled to approach the gates.  I ask you – will it ever be rebuilt?
tagChangan_Citizen2_A7=No, stranger, I have lost too much to hope.  
tagChangan_Storyteller_A2=These are terrible times, times of great woe to the living.  And so it is we should hear about Nuwa, the mother of all mortals.  Of clay she made us, after she made all the animals, to fill the world so it would not be empty.  And then, when the great monster Gong Gong broke the pillar that held the heavens aloft, it was Nuwa who set it right.  When the four directions were scattered, she returned north to north, and south the other way, where it belongs.  Her husband was Fu Xi, who taught mortals to be civilized, and many other useful things.
tagChangan_Storyteller_A7=The world is broken again.  Will Nuwa come to fix it?  Or will some mortal fix it - this time?
tagJadePalace_Villager2_A2=Some cry and curse against these monsters, but they, too, are part of The Way.  A wise man accepts, studies – and then fights without fear or desire.
tagJadePalace_Villager2_A3=Life is harder out of the city.  We have no walls and soldiers to protect us.  Ah, but out here, we are tougher, too!
tagJadePalace_Villager2_A4='Who can keep still until it is time to act?' the great sage asks.  Balance is required in all things.  But perhaps you have learned this lesson?
tagJadePalace_Villager2_A5=In truth, I do not believe the monsters will prevail.  But to survive, we must perfect ourselves and embrace The Way.  For The Way is immortal and at peace.  It can never be defeated.
tagJadePalace_Villager2_A6=As a child, I remember great festivals with flowers, brightly-colored costumes, lanterns and fireworks.  And I would climb the mountain, sometimes to sit and play my reed pipe. 
tagJadePalace_Villager2_A7=These times are troubled so that heroes will be born.
tagJadePalace_StoryTeller_A2=It is said that before the great sage Lao Tzu left his post at the Imperial Library, Confucius found him there, and they talked for many days.  It is said Confucius learned more from the sage than all the books in the whole library.  When Lao Tzu left, he rode west on his water buffalo.  Far at a western gate, a guard stopped him.  'Before you go, Great Master,' he pleaded, 'write down your teachings.  If you do not, they will surely be forgotten and lost!'  And because of this, we have the Tao Te Ching.  Then Lao Tzu went west - he went into the desert, gone from all mortal eyes.
tagJadePalace_StoryTeller_A7=The Tao, 'The Way', is what Master Lao taught.  To be in harmony with the way is to prevail.  To be in harmony with it, one must be quiet, still - an uncarved block.  Only then can one act.
